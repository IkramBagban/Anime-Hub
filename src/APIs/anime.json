        "description": "Gold Roger was known as the Pirate King, the strongest and most infamous being to have sailed the Grand Line. The capture and death of Roger by the World Government brought a change throughout the world. His last words before his death revealed the location of the greatest treasure in the world, One Piece. It was this revelation that brought about the Grand Age of Pirates, men who dreamed of finding One Piece (which promises an unlimited amount of riches and fame), and quite possibly the most coveted of titles for the person who found it, the title of the Pirate King.<br><br>\nEnter Monkey D. Luffy, a 17-year-old boy that defies your standard definition of a pirate. Rather than the popular persona of a wicked, hardened, toothless pirate who ransacks villages for fun, Luffy’s reason for being a pirate is one of pure wonder; the thought of an exciting adventure and meeting new and intriguing people, along with finding One Piece, are his reasons of becoming a pirate. Following in the footsteps of his childhood hero, Luffy and his crew travel across the Grand Line, experiencing crazy adventures, unveiling dark mysteries and battling strong enemies, all in order to reach One Piece.<br><br>\n<b>*This includes following special episodes:</b><br>\n- Chopperman to the Rescue!

                    "description": "__Height::__ 212 cm (6'11½\")\n__Affiliation:__ Galley-La Company ~!CP9 (former); CP-0!~\n__Devil Fruit:__ Neko Neko no Mi, Model: Leopard (Cat-Cat Fruit Leopard Model)\n__Devil Fruit Type:__ Zoan \n\nWhen Lucci is first seen as one of the five foremen of Galley-La Company's Dock One, he appears to be a ventriloquist using his pigeon, Hattori, to speak for him. He also shows very impressive skills when he gets into a fight with Paulie and, later on, Luffy. \n\n~!It is soon revealed he is the unquestioned leader of the Water 7 CP9 unit which infiltrated the Galley-La company, and perfectly capable of speaking for himself. Lucci ate the Neko Neko no Mi, Model: Leopard (ネコネコの実 モデル豹(レオパルド), Cat Cat Fruit, Model: Leopard ), which allows him to turn into a huge leopard-human hybrid and a full leopard. This coupled with his mastered martial arts style of rokushiki, makes him a resilient foe, and he has been ranked as the strongest CP9 agent by far. Lucci can perform Life Return, like Kumadori, and use it to alter his body into forms that amplify his skills in a specific rokushiki ability, though only Kami-e Form, which makes his man-beast form smaller and thinner, has been seen and arguably the main villain of the Enies Lobby Arc if not the main threat to the Straw Hats at the time.!~ \n\n~!In the anime, Lucci&#039;s backstory to his admission in CP9 is revealed by a Vice Admiral during the Buster Call on Enies Lobby. Fifteen years prior, a kingdom had 500 of its soldiers and its king taken hostage by a pirate crew, with the captain demanding to be made the new king of the kingdom. As the government saw the king beginning to admit defeat, they sent in the then thirteen year-old Rob Lucci, who mercilessly killed all 500 hostages to get to the captain, whom he killed without mercy. During this incident, he gained a back full of scars from the pirate crew&#039;s guns, vaguely scarred in the shape of the World Government&#039;s symbol. Shortly after that he became a CP9 member, and gained the reputation of being the group&#039;s most cold-hearted and efficient assassin in its entire history. As such, he is a very valuable asset to the World Government, almost to the point of legend; the other vice admirals believe that he can even survive a Buster Call attack.    At the Galley-La headquarters in Water 7, Lucci effortlessly defeated Luffy in a relatively short fight. Later in Enies Lobby, Luffy chased after Lucci and initiated a second fight with him. The two engaged in an extremely long, hectic and boisterous fight in which Luffy eventually emerged victorius. Lucci respectively bested, withstood and survived Luffy&#039;s attacks and various states until he was defeated. However, it took Luffy&#039;s last bits of energy to defeat him, as Luffy was in the floor and couldn&#039;t even move. This proves how much of a monster Lucci was, but also how much stronger Luffy has become.!~\n\n~!Lucci comes off as the most cold and collected member of CP9, almost never displaying any emotions. An example is the brutal assault on his friend of five years, Paulie, whom he even tried to kill after the CP9&#039;s identities have been revealed. He also states that he feels no real bond with the city he&#039;s lived in for those five years. He also seems to have no feelings for his fellow CP9 colleagues, least of all Spandam. His emotionless nature includes anger and distress (he&#039;s &quot;kept together&quot; all through his fight with Luffy, unlike all the previous villains). Even while taunting or demoralizing Luffy, he keeps a passive face, and refrains from the classic &quot;villain laugh&quot;. However, during the final moments of his fight with Luffy, he expresses surprise and anger prior to being defeated.  He seems to derive amusement and gratification from inflicting physical and emotional pain on others, making him a typical sadist. These scenes, along with when he anticipates battle, are the only times where he smirks. In Enies Lobby, he reveals that he works so he could be legally allowed to kill people. An example of Lucci&#039;s lust for violence is when he compromised the mission of bringing Robin to the Gates of Justice by allowing Luffy to tail him, for the sole purpose of having a battle. Lucci&#039;s violent and predatory nature is also shown when he goes into full-beast mode during battle, in order to attack Luffy more violently.  However, while Lucci does love the benefits of his job (killing people), he seems to be completely devoted to the government he serves as a tool from the shadows. He speaks of pirates as &quot;evil&quot;, and sees it as his duty to hunt down and eliminate Nico Robin. All this is revealed towards the end of his battle with Luffy, and is a sudden departure from his &quot;care for nothing but blood&quot; attitude. This may be because he was dominating the fight at the time, and his bloodlust, which otherwise overshadows his better judgement, had worn off since Luffy was no longer fun to fight. However, as his flashback in the anime shows, this moral isn&#039;t just limited to pirates. If Lucci sees anybody that he believes faulters in the face of justice, they have &quot;sinned&quot; in his eyes and must be eliminated. This is his own sense of justice which he calls &quot;dark justice&quot;. Lucci also appears to exhibit a rather high level of intelligence. It was he who deduced the connection between Iceburg and Franky, figured out the principles behind Luffy&#039;s Gear 2nd &quot;upgrade&quot;, and showed extensive knowledge about Devil Fruit. On Enies Lobby, he even effortlessly jeopardized the lives of Luffy&#039;s crewmembers and friends, as well as their mission to save Robin, by flooding the underwater passageway to the Gates of Justice. Although this might just as well be yet another display of sadism, where he removes Luffy&#039;s chances of &quot;having everything&quot; just for the sake of angering him. Lucci has a complete mastery of Rokushiki, having not only used at least one or more moves from each of the different forms with ease, but to such an extent that he can mix two or more forms together to great effect. He demonstrates this when he unveils the Rokushiki hidden technique, Rokuougan, during his fight with Luffy. The massively powerful technique, usable only by one who has literally mastered all six forms as stated by Lucci himself, is so strong that it causes severe internal injury to Luffy&#039;s body; no small feat considering he has a rubber body. Luffy described it as if an &#039;Impact Dial&#039; with much more greatly amplified power went off inside his chest. Not much is known about Hattori, the pigeon that is constantly seen perched on Lucci&#039;s shoulder. It appears to have no special significance. While acting as Lucci&#039;s voice Hattori expresses human body language, matching the behavior of a professional shipwright: constantly insulting and lecturing Paulie because of his reckless lifestyle. After the CP9 reveal their identities, Hattori loses many of his human characteristics, although he is seen wearing a coat and drinking from a cocktail glass.!~",

He is a young apprentice chef who joined the Marines in hope of finding the All Blue.  ~!Tajio had been apprenticed on his ship for six months; in that time, all he had done was wash dishes and peel some things. The episode takes place on a foggy day, the day the captains of his Marine fleet are expected to have curry for lunch, and the day his ship is supposed to make it. Tajio accidentally spills the curry on the floor, and when he apologizes to the chef, he is ordered to remake it himself. He tries several times, but never succeeds. He goes outside on the deck, and then falls from his ship when startled by the presence of the Straw Hat Pirates' ship passing close by in the fog bank.  After coming to and trying a dish Sanji made, Tajio tells his story. Sanji accompanies him back to his ship with Luffy's help, then gives him some encouragement. Tajio realizes that he was expected to learn from the skills that the chef demonstrated in the kitchen, rather than receive instructions. He decides to try once more, and with his chef's advice in mind, along with a bit of help from Sanji – who tries his best to appear indifferent – to spark his memory, Tajio succeeds. Shortly after, Luffy gets spotted, and the two Straw Hats make a hasty retreat back to the Going Merry.  Before he leaves, Sanji tells Tajio that he also believes in the All Blue. Tajio assists them in their escape by saying that he did not see anyone when asked by pursuing Marines. Later, when the curry is served, all the captains enjoy it greatly. The chef cryptically praises Tajio, then walks away. Tajio looks out the window and sees the Going Merry sailing away. He promises Sanji that he will work hard, and someday be as good as him. !~  First Appearance:\tEpisode 133  Source: http://onepiece.wikia.com/wiki/Tajio",

Later in the manga (in a title page arc that was never animated), Hatchan goes on many adventures, meeting a mermaid, that ends with him opening a floating takoyaki restaurant. In Hatchan's Sea-Floor Stroll, it's revealed that Hatchan, along with Chu and Kuroobi, planned to open a takoyaki store when they were younger. \n\nHis nickname Hachi could also mean eight in Japanese, a reference to him being an octopus fish-man. Hatchan's name is quite strange. In the Japanese language, chan is a diminutive suffix, added to the end of someone's name, giving it the meaning of \"cute\" or \"little\". However, Hatchan insists that his name is Hatchan and that Hachi is just a nickname. When questioned on this, Oda replied that the chan is the same as the last name of \"Chan\" common in Chinese, rather than the suffix -chan.   ",

Goro Goro no Mi (Rumble-Rumble Fruit)!~\n__Type:__ ~!Logia!~\n\nEnel thinks of himself as an invincible god - quite literally. He believes that he is a divine and immortal being, with the authority to do, take or destroy whatever he pleases. As the result, he appears fearless, childish, and without a care in the world. His lifestyle is relaxed and hedonistic, and when not attending to his godly duties of smiting the natives of Skypiea, he spends his time sleeping or eating (Enel's favorite fruit is apples) in his residence, being waited on hand and foot by beautiful women. This attitude carries over to his battles, where he's hardly serious and barely annoyed - instead he's relaxed, and enjoys himself by effortlessly absorbing attacks, and humiliating his opponents. In his fight against Kamakiri, he even went to sleep in the middle of the fight, in order to prove his immortality.  Enel holds no regard for other's lives except his own, and has no moral qualms about killing thousands- instead he sees it as his godly duty, and laughs as he sends Skypiea to its doom. He is in short completely insane, which was more or less undeniable when he sets off for the moon, which he believes to be the home of God (himself). Before Luffy showed up, his fruit power and mantra ability made his God complex completely legitimate. Once Luffy began gaining the upper hand in the battle he incapacitated him, in order to remove him as a threat, and reclaim his status as \"invincible\" - and from this point acts somewhat cowardly, trying his best to avoid another confrontation with Luffy.  Enel appears to posses a vast knowledge of mechanics and technology as well. He personally designed his flying ark, Maxim, and knows its inner workings inside and out; if any damage is done to the inside, he is able to repair it (assuming it's repairable). He was even able to design a stormcloud production system (known as Deathpiea), an electrical power system, and a Jet Dial failsafe for the ark, in the event that the main engines are damaged. \n\nAfter Skypiea:\n\n~!After the Skypiea arc, Enel can be seen throughout chapter covers in an adventure called *\"Enel's Great Space Operations\"*. He sees the first lieutenant inside a crater after experiencing devastating defeat. After, the Fox-like space pirates attack once again, and seeing his \"Fairy Vearth\" blown up, he attacks the space pirates almost decimating their forces whilst also charging the generator used by the moonlings. Enel receives thanks and leaves to explore deeper into the crater. He encounters an ancient city and from his overwhelming strength come back. Finally he studies old murals and discovers his abundance of followers and land.!~",

A statue of him was erected after his death as an eternal reminder to the Shandians of his strength and courage. He had a daughter named Musse. Wiper is a direct descendant of his.    Calgara was quick to react and a strong believer in traditions of his people. He was hugely mistrusting of strangers. Calgara's personality changed after he met Norland with many of his outtakes of the world changing alongside it. One particular note was that after seeing his God for what it truly was (a giant snake), he dismisses all Gods including the Skypieans &quot;God&quot;.",

Ace's back tattoo is left intact in the English version of the dub despite 4Kids' previous edits to crosses. At the same time Ace also promotes his tattoo to Luffy, something which is truly considered odd by 4Kids standards. Ace has a tattoo on his back of the Whitebeard symbol; a skull with a white mustache and a manji behind it. To avoid confusion between the two symbols and avoid slander for being a nazi, this was changed to crossbones in the shape of a \"cross\" in the anime, as well as in the most recent chapter of the manga.  Ace has another tattoo on his left arm by the shoulder: it reads \"ASCE\" with the \"S\" crossed out. ~!It serves as a symbol of his other deceased sworn brother Sabo.!~ In the English version of the anime, Ace's shoulder tattoo signifying his name is edited out, as he is referred to there as \"Portgaz D. Trace.\" He appears in One Piece Grand Adventure, once again without the tattoo on his arm.  Ace travels around the Grand Line on his boat which is constructed so his Mera Mera no Mi fuels the engine on the rear end allowing it to move.  Currently, Ace is one of the two known pirates to ever escape arrest by the Marine captain Smoker, the other escapee being Ace's younger brother Luffy. Ace and Smoker fought to a standstill in Alabasta.  He left Fuusha Village three years before Luffy, and he is a loyal crewman and commands the Second Division of Whitebeard, his captain.  In appearance, the two brothers are obviously related, despite the fact that Ace is more muscular than the rather lanky Luffy. He also sports rather childish freckles. He is apparently narcoleptic (a trait common amongst Ace's family) and therefore falls asleep on random occasions, making people wonder if he has dropped dead. As far as personality goes, Ace is much more intelligent, polite, and generally more bearable than his younger brother, which prompts the Straw Hat crew to question whether he is truly related to their bumbling captain. However, the brothers themselves are very close, Ace portraying typical good-big-brother behaviors such as asking the crew to keep an eye on his little brother.\n\n~!It is later revealed that Ace is not biologically related to Luffy at all, but is in fact the son of Gol D. Roger and Portgas D. Rouge. Ace took his mothers surname as a thanks for trading her own life while giving birth to him. Ace also hates his father for 'abandoning' his mother.!~\n\n~!During Ace's time in the Whitebeard Pirates, one of the members of his division, Marshall D. Teach (later known as Blackbeard), murders the 4th Division Commander, Thatch, for finding the Yami Yami no Mi, and steals it from him. As Teach defects from the Whitebeard Pirates, Ace sets out to avenge Thatch by chasing down Teach and finishing him off himself for committing such a cowardly and spiteful act. After the events of CP9's defeat at Enies Lobby, Ace finally catches up to Teach at Banaro Island and engages in a battle with him, ultimately resulting in defeat and being sent to Impel Down by Teach. Ace was imprisoned in Level 6 of Impel Down, and his defeat sets the stage for the entirety of the Summit War Saga, as well as the remainder of the first half of the story.!~\n\n~!In Paramount War, after Ace was failed to be executed twice (the first effort was due to Crocodile's Desert Spada, as he did not want the Marines to have it their way, and the second effort was due to Luffy unleashing Haoshoku Haki on the battlefield), Luffy finally arrives on the execution platform to save him. Alhthough, Kizaru destroys the keys for Ace's handcuffs and Sengoku decides to execute Luffy and Ace himself with his Devil Fruit powers. However, with the help and protection of Mr. 3 and Luffy, Ace is finally free from his handcuffs.!~\n\n~! Although Ace is freed and attempts to flee Marineford with the Whitebeard Pirates, he is taunted by Akainu's words belittling Whitebeard. Fed in by Akainu's words, Ace retaliates against Akainu only to be getting burnt by his magma, leaving Luffy vulnerable looking at Ace's Vivre Card. As Akainu looks at this as an open opportunity to kill Luffy, Ace takes the hit and ultimately sacrifices his life, having his internal organs charred by Akainu, and dies in his brother's arms, thanking Luffy for how much he was loved as a brother, even if he had the blood of the Pirate King. His death eradicated the Gol D. bloodline and in postmortem, paved Luffy to undergo training for two years, so that Luffy would not have to lose anyone dear to him, like Ace, ever again.!~",

He was nominated by Sengoku for the position of fleet admiral. However, after losing the position to Akainu, he resigned from the Marines.   Kuzan is a very laid back man, showing no shock or surprise from almost anything. His lack of interest and lazy justice (as he describes his motto himself) let others often believe he can not possibly be a marine of such a high ranking. However, if he deems a situation worthy, he will take action, as shown when he created a passage to another island for a few injured castaways at Long Ring Long Land.  He seems to be the kindest of the three admirals, helping Tonjit at Long Ring Land to cross the ocean with the power of his Devil Fruit and even letting Nico Robin escape the Buster Call on Ohara. He seems to dislike the Shichibukai, or at least Crocodile; he said that the only reason he did not kill Luffy was that Luffy had defeated Crocodile.   In contrast to his fellow admiral Sakazuki, Kuzan has a sense of honour, as he keeps his word to not attack the Straw Hats after accepting a one-on-one fight with Luffy. Kuzan's moral stance is unknown, but it is likely that he follows Moral Justice. He is disgusted by Sakazuki's brutal actions in dealing with situations (such as the Ohara Incident), calling him a fool. While he may follow Moral Justice, he does understand the position his ranking puts him in, as he does not hesitate to do what is necessary for the needs of the Marines, as shown when he freezes Jaguar D. Saul after the Ohara incident, and attacked Luffy and Whitebeard during the Marineford War.  Aokiji was a faithful follower of the World Government. He always tried to obey orders but sometimes found his own ideals in opposition to his orders. Even as he followed his orders, he would sometimes exhibit a sense of mercy and honor that other World Government officials did not. Like many characters in One Piece (for example, Jaguar D. Saul and Smoker), after witnessing the senseless murder of many innocent people, Aokiji may have come to realise how low these events have sunk the World Government.  His relaxed demeanour while performing the more macabre of his duties is similar to that of Borsalino, making him one of the more complicated characters in the series. Despite not really wanting the position of fleet admiral, he was even more opposed to Sakazuki getting the position, and fought his fellow admiral rather than letting him take it. After being defeated, Kuzan chose to resign from the Marines rather than stay under Akainu's command. ",

Franky called her \"shrimp\". \n\n~!She also tends to notice things that others cannot, such as when she spotted Luffy wedged between two buildings (which is where he landed after Rob Lucci knocked him out of Galley-La Corporation Headquarters) or how she managed to find secret passageways in the Tower of Justice at Enies Lobby. She, along with Gonbe, later sneak aboard the prototype Sea Train, Rocketman, and accompany the Straw Hats, Franky Family, and Galley-La foremen to Enies Lobby. And later helped Luffy find the secret passageway that Spandam, Lucci and Robin took on the way to the Gate of Justice.!~\n\n~!As Kokoro is revealed to be a mermaid, it is possible that Chimney, being her granddaughter, may have latent mermaid abilities of her own. Although Chimney doesn't seem to have any mermaid characteristics, she was able to save Luffy, who is 3 times her size, from drowning off screen while resisting what must have been an overwhelming current from the several whirlpools in the sea in front of the Gate of Justice.    Currently, she is in Water Seven. In the Volume 45 SBS, Oda revealed that Chimney is indeed 1/4 mermaid, and is thus an abnormally good swimmer.!~",

He loves to tell tall tales to Chopper (who believes him blindly) or anyone who's listening. The other aspect of Usopp besides his lying is his cowardice; he is a very timid person, or so he thinks. In extremely stressful situations, Usopp has proven to be far more courageous than he believes himself to be. He shows great resolve when his friends are threatened or mocked by outsiders. Even though he is a complete coward in battle (except as his alter ego, Sogeking), he is a useful part to the Straw Hat Pirates. He is extremely handy and can fix almost anything. He sometimes sees a role model in Zoro who never seems afraid but always proud. Usopp lacks a bit of self esteem and is often taken advantage of by Nami to make her weapons or repair and improve them - something he is very adept at, having constructed the ingenious weapon \"Clima Tact.\" \n\n Usopp will also stand up and fight for not only the well-being of people, but also for their ideals - and the ideals of a pirate, which he holds very high. In battle he normally tries to trick his enemy by telling tales or mischievous lies to deceive them. Despite his lack of physical strength compared to other members of the crew, Usopp seems to be just as resilient as his comrades and this ability to bear loads and loads of damage, is one of his best traits, in addition to his cunning and intelligence, which has saved the Straw Hats on many occasions. Also, Usopp has outstanding marksmanship abilities with his slingshot and is on his way to becoming one of the best snipers in the One Piece world, although his goal in life is to become a proud and strong pirate like his father Yassop of the Red Haired Pirate Crew.",

Formerly Sherry of the Black Organization, she is on the run from them and lives with Professor Agasa. She is also one of the few characters who know that Shinichi is Conan. \n\nTo prevent the knowledge of her transfiguration from being discovered, Shiho and Professor Agasa create her alias Ai Haibara.

Following her first adventure with the Detective Boys, she reveals her true identity as the developer of APTX 4869 to Conan. Also accurately deduces Conan as Shinichi in the shrunken form, though her deduction is based on prior knowledge of her research and investigation of Shinichi Kudo. Conan protests her presence, but as time passes, he accepts her as a friend, though her cynicism and secretive air still rail him at times. Although she does not think too highly of the Detective Boys' immature antics, she has come to value them all as close friends.\n\nHaibara has begun working on an antidote for the APTX 4869, but since most of the important data had been stored on computer files, which are now mostly destroyed, the work progresses slowly. Conan also eventually succeeds in persuading Vermouth to leave Haibara in peace after ruining a murderous plot. This fragile peace lasts until Sherry's whereabouts leak to the rest of the Black Organization and a second murder plot occurs aboard a train. A counter plan results in an explosion that preserves Shiho's secret identity. Currently all major Black Organization members besides Vermouth believe Sherry is dead. !~",

                    "description": "As a child, Shiratori studied diligently to one day become a lawyer, and had even memorized some laws by heart. One day, he witnessed a young girl confronting two juveniles trying to steal mangas from a bookstore. When the two offenders had pushed the girl to the floor for her protests, and seemed about to hurt her, Shiratori had stepped forward to recite the provisions made in the Japanese Law to punish stealing. This somewhat unnerved the juveniles and attracted the attention of the store owner and the other customers, causing the offenders to hastily get away. To thank him for helping her out, the girl bought him a drink and made a sakura petal pattern from the straw wrapper, saying that the sakura was the symbol of courage for the Japanese police _(due to the distinct form of the Japanese police badge),_ and Shiratori had acted with courage just like them. It was because of this incident that Shiratori decided to become a cop rather than a lawyer, and also started to consider the girl to be his childhood love.\n\nShiratori later joined the Tokyo Metropolian Police Department and worked alongside [Inspector Megure,](https://anilist.co/character/4253/Juzo-Megure) often acting as an extra officer or pair of eyes, though he later became an inspector of his own. When [Miwako Sato](https://anilist.co/character/13975/Miwako-Satou) joined the department, Shiratori believed that he had found his childhood love again, and as a result both he and his younger colleague [Takagi](https://anilist.co/character/9421/Wataru-Takagi) considered each other rivals for Sato's affections. Shiratori would often try to show off in front of Takagi by asking Sato on a date, but she always rejected him, much to his dismay.\n\n~!In pursuit of love, Shiratori has a one track mind and is willing to abuse his police powers to achieve his desire. He even became the leader of a secret police group which protected Miwako Sato from the affections of other police officers like Takagi. Shiratori fixated on Sato because he believed she was the childhood crush who completely changed his life at a chance meeting in a bookstore. Shiratori is crushed when Sato chooses Takagi in the end, and can't truly give up his feelings for her. He later discovers that [Sumiko Kobayashi](https://anilist.co/character/30356/Sumiko-Kobayashi) is the true girl from his childhood memories. Once the realization sets in, Shiratori's Sato complex dissolves and he develops an affection for Sumiko that soon blossoms into mutual love. Meeting Sumiko has also helped cure his arrogance to a large degree. Shiratori more than once tried to use his riches to get an edge over Takagi over Sato in the past, but now that he's with Kobayashi he does it solely to make her happy. He's noticeably more friendly towards Conan, Ai and the Detective Boys as time passes.!~\n\n(Source: Detective Conan World)",

Ran's father Kogoro Mouri, owns a Detective Agency which Conan uses to his advantage to discover cases involving the Black Organization.\n\nAs Conan, Shinichi helps Ran's father solve cases by putting him to sleep and simulating Kogoro's voice using the special bowtie gadget Professor Agasa made for him.

He met Misae at the age of 29, and after dating for around a year the two wed. He is a loving father to his two children, and ultimately a devoted husband. While he is the family bread-winner, he hands the reins of finance over to his wife, who maintains a totalitarian level of control on family spending. At age 35, he is a stereotypical Japanese salaryman, working eight-hour days, enduring overstuffed trains, enjoying the occasional nightlife, and giving every bit of his take home pay to his wife every month. While his relationship with his family is positive on the whole, there is an abundance of recurring conflict. He and his wife bicker on many different things, from how little he gets for spending money every month, to whose turn it is to give the baby a bath. Misae is also notorious for inflicting violence on Hiroshi whenever she gets very angry (usually when his gaze wanders to younger women). He often dreams about being a playboy while he sleeps as an escape, though this is usually interrupted by some external stimulation. He enjoys a playful relationship with his children; but sometimes they're the source of his daily woes. He loves a cold beer after work and shares Shin-chan's appreciation of TV shows with young women in skimpy clothing, often getting too excited about it for Misae's liking. He will not hesitate to save his allowance for things he wants, but can be seen spending much of it to buy his family creature comforts. A running joke is made of the pungent odor of his feet and his socks are often used as weapons by other members of the family.  [Source: Wikipedia]",

He is 5 years old and loves Chocobis and an animated superhero named \"Action Kamen\". He is attracted to older girls and women, despite his young age. He brazenly pursues any girl who catches his eye. He shares this trait with his father and paternal grandfather, but this often results in Mom's cruel punishment. The only girl he seems to really like is a college student named Nanako. Some of his strange activities include dressing up and mooning. In general, he is brutally honest, highly curious, and has no shame whatsoever. Ironically, there have been several instances in which his antics actually solved the problems of those around him. He also displays a surprising amount of talent at various activities including kendo. On rare occasions, he displays bouts of selfless kindness (for example, in one anime episode he saved a frog from a truck on a rainy day, getting all wet and dirty and risking Misae's ire since it was his last set of clean clothes), but these are often immediately followed by antics that negate the goodwill others feel. There are also times when Shin Chan displays a level of maturity beyond his usual self in his concern for others. For example, during the trip to Australia where he bumps into Kazama, he kindheartedly arranged for Kazama's father to play ball with his son after Shin Chan notices him being sad on the beach.",

He is well-loved by his class, as well as the other nintama and staff of the Ninjutsu Academy. Outside of his job as a teacher, Doi works proficiently as a ninja.

His name comes from the fact that he is a super hero with a head made of bread (Japanese: pan, a loanword from the Portuguese word meaning \"bread\") that is filled with Red bean paste (Japanese: an) called an anpan. He doesn't need to eat or drink to sustain himself and has never been seen eating. It is believed the bean jam in his head gives him sustenance. His weakness is water or anything that makes his head dirty. He regains his health and strength when Jam Ojisan bakes him a new head and it is placed on his shoulders. Anpanman's damaged head, with Xs in his eyes, flies off his shoulders once a new baked head lands. He was created when a shooting star landed in Uncle Jam's oven while he was baking. He has two special attacks known as the An-punch and An-kick (with stronger variations of both). When Anpanman comes across a starving creature or person, he lets the unfortunate creature or person eat part of his head. He also has super hearing in that he can respond to anyone that calls his name out in distress from anywhere in the world. He forms a trio with Shokupanman and Currypanman. ",

The show is the ultimate family program and tends to follow traditional themes. Think of this show as the Japanese equivalent to \"The Partridge Family\" and you'll get a good feel for this show's atmosphere. Don't expect to see things like violence, swearing, kung-fu action or magical girls. The plots are more like \"Today, Sazae-san goes to the new mall and gets lost\". Such \"boring\" plotlines and the simplistic art are often a turn-off to non-Japanese audiences, but most Japanese find the show incredibly good. As a result, it continues to be one of the top ratings grabbers on TV and is one of the few anime that is considered \"acceptable\" by adults.",

Nobita often disrupts her in the bath due to some misuse of Doraemon's gadgets, resulting in Nobita's head getting dunked. She is also known for taking piano lessons unwillingly, which is sometimes used as an excuse for declining to hang out with Nobita. Her true passions are sweet potatoes, which she'd rather keep to herself out of the knowledge of others, and the violin, in which her playing is as atrocious as Gian's singing. Due to Doraemon's intervention, Shizuka will become Nobita's wife in the future timeline, and the mother of his son.",

He is known for his confidence in his terrible singing voice, though he considers himself a great singer. He regularly subjects the neighborhood children to horrendous singing recitals, which is sometimes combined with his equally bad homemade dinner and his atrocious fashion sense. He also frequently steals other children's toys and books under the pretext of \"borrowing\" them, unless the toy is damaged. This is how most fans considered Gian to be the antagonist of this show. However, he does not hesitate to help Nobita and his friends when they are in real trouble, which often occurs in the movies. Several of the stories revolve around Nobita and his friends' efforts to avoid Gian's concerts, and several chapters summarize his friends efforts to avoid visiting Gian's house on his birthday because of his selfish nature. After reflecting on one event about his birthday, Gian thought of himself why he wasn't popular among his peers. After getting a lecture from Doraemon to see what an unruly character he is, Gian realize that he should have been a better person and he begs Doraemon to give him another chance. However, things didn't go exactly as planned when his friends at school or at the streets mock him to see how weird Gian was acting and get kicked by Suneo after learning his attempt to become gentle to his peers. This led him to lose control of his temper and start attacking his friends again. Although he bullies the other children (mostly Nobita), he is terrified of his mother, who runs the local grocery store, a fact Nobita and Doraemon sometimes use in their favor. He founded his own baseball team named after himself. Although Nobita is often blamed for the losses against the baseball team's rival, the \"Tyranos\", Gian and Suneo still force Nobita to play because they do not have enough players. Gian also has a younger sister named Jaiko, whom he adores.",

Though she initially couldn't stand Guts, Schierke has developed a slight infatuation with him and both now share a father-daughter relationship.

Serpico uses two items blessed by the wind spirit Sylph in order to battle with tolerance alongside Guts: a rapier that can generate razor sharp gusts of wind; and a cloak that constantly generates a swirling vortex around its wearer which can deflect projectiles, assist in jumping, and slow falls from great heights.",

Puck was the first to join Guts's journey, and is starting to show a strange attachment to the Behelit Guts took upon his battle with the Count.  Puck often serves as comic relief along with Isidro. The two are frequently drawn in an exaggerated manner. He is very angry when he ever is mixed up with a Pixie or Fairy quick to state the difference. He also seems to have a brother-sister relationship with the newest comic relief character the female elf Evarella.",

Since this position has been traditionally held by a woman, Farnese was appointed during her stay at the convent she was sent to by her father, Federico Vandimion.   A bit of a pyromaniac (and possibly a pyrophiliac), Farnese's habit of maniacally burning things she didn't like, along with her lack of empathy due to her poor upbringing provoked her to hunt down and burn supposed witches and pagans at the stake. This fueled a secret sadistic pleasure that she constantly tried to deny.   She and Serpico left their Holy See positions after her faith was shattered during the devastation of Albion and the events surrounding Griffith's reincarnation. She then chose to follow Guts in hopes of learning more about the world and has changed into a more sympathetic human being. Since then, Farnese has begun to study witchcraft under Schierke's tutelage. Farnese also seems to have developed a crush on Guts which becomes evident in chapter 287 and 288 of the manga.  Farnese is primarily Casca's care taker and thus rarely involves herself in battles. She and Casca both received enchanted chainmail shirts made of silver as well as a silver short sword for protection against creatures from the astral plane. During Ganishka's raid on Vritanis, she also received a trio of snake-like homonculi created by Schierke from thorn vines which Farnese remote controls with a vine ring.",

Though ominous and macabre, he is an enemy of the Godhand and its acolytes, hunting down Apostles and devouring their Behelits; especially bitter is his rivalry with Zodd the Immortal, whom he was often showed to overwhelm with ease.   He wields a powerful sword that, when stuck down his throat, becomes a terrible, Behelit-coated blade capable of slashing rifts through reality itself, thus allowing the Skull Knight to move freely around the world or even between different dimensions.   This enigmatic knight saved Guts in more than one occasion, notably during the infamous Eclipse which saw Griffith become a member of the Hand of God or when Slan almost slaughtered him, though he never explained why, simply declaring that the Struggler (the way he calls Guts) has to keep following his fate. He was the wearer of the Berserker's Armor, and knew the witch Flora. During the duel between Griffith and Ganishka he suddenly appeared out of thin air through a dimensional rift, trying to land a fatal blow on the Hawk, only to see it diverted on the writhing body of the Kushan Emperor.\n\n~!It is heavily speculated that, during his life as a mortal, the Skull Knight was in fact Gaiseric, the warlord that unified the Midland and became its first Emperor, notorious for his helmet whose shape was that of a human skull and whose ambitions 'prompted God to send four Angels' (most likely the four members of the Hand of God) to punish him.!~ ",

He&#039;s the main antagonist in the Tower of Conviction, hindering with his excessive religious zeal Guts&#039; efforts in saving Casca. His symbol are four torture wheels, embodying his willingness to use torture as a way to cleanse people from evil.    [/b]Life[/b]    Mozgus, prior to the events told in the Resurrection Arc was a zealous Inquisitor, acting on behalf of the Holy See. There he recruited a small group of marginalized, disfigured individuals, comforting them by reading parts of the Holy See Doctrine, meant to reassure them that even their disfigurements were meant to be worn with pride as a gift from God, and training them in his particular brand of torture, vicious and rarely leading its survivors to walk away without serious wounds.    He is then sent to St. Albion to root out heretics on the behalf of the Holy See, requesting the Holy Iron Chain Knights as his personal guard. Albeit a true heretical group is brewing in the mountains surrounding St. Albion, based on orgiastic rituals, Mozgus himself apparently does little to stop them, managing to capture many of them only by Farnese&#039;s intervention. Instead, he sets every bit of his attention towards smothering in blood and torture the rebellions of the poor and starving population of St. Albion against the tyrannical rule of the Holy See. Mozgus sees such acts of defiance against himself as defiance against God, whose rule he&#039;s meant to embody.    Physically tall and strong, harsh and demanding with everyone, even himself, he impresses Farnese by smothering several rebellions with threat of death and torture, sparing only a young mother asking more food for her starving child. Though Mozgus does give the child food and medical attention, he sentences the woman to torture with a tearful prayer that she survive the &quot;test&quot; that God has prepared for her, and attempting to use the encounter as a lesson to Farnese about the harshness of God&#039;s doctrine.     ~!Upon capturing Casca, mistaken as a witch by the local heretics and priests alike, he realizes how the recent accounts of the Black Swordsman may be related to the mute, amnesiac branded girl, so, as usual, tries to torture her as a way to get some more information. Instead, he merely triggers the appearance of a huge band of demons, attracted by the Tower itself, chosen place for the Incarnation Ceremony, and the presence of the Brand. Mozgus doesn&#039;t flinch at all, instead closing himself in the chapel of the Tower of Rebirth, where the Apostle-Behelit uses his venom to turn Mozgus and his servants into Apostle-spawns with angelic features, as a way to hasten the Incarnation Ceremony.    Without ever knowing what befell him, Mozgus believes that his angelic wings, his increased stamina and the growing of a scaly hide able to withstand blows from the Dragonslayer and Guts&#039; arm cannon were gifts from God, and decides, as a way to stop the Ceremony and quell the population&#039;s fears, to burn Casca at the stake, forcing Guts to come out.    After an heated battle against his mutated servants, Guts himself is almost defeated by Mozgus, until he manages to drive his sword into the only weak spot in Mozgus&#039; hide: a small, weaker plate with the Holy See insignia, a representation of the Holy Book he always brings with him. Shortly after his death, the Incarnation Ceremony is completed, with Griffith&#039;s rebirth and the total destruction of St. Albion.!~     _source: http://berserk.wikia.com/wiki/Mozgus _",

He is often seen to be attended by many very young male servants, no older than being in their teens.

When General Boscone reveals that the Band of the Hawk's leader is Griffith, his obsession starts to cloud his judgement, which would eventually lead to his defeat. When the Band of the Hawk attacked Doldrey as part of Midland's regular army during the One Hundred Years War, Gennon became so obsessed with capturing Griffith to the detriment of his greater military objectives. Chuder lost the battle, in large part because Gennon overrode the military command structure and took direct control of Chuder's forces, which was all in Griffith's plan. In his final moments, he pleaded with Griffith, telling him that all he wanted was to have him back. This plea fell upon deaf ears as Gennon was killed by Griffith after the main part of Chuder's army fled the battlefield following the death of General Boscone at Guts's hands.!~",

Although he was killed before he could be seen without his armor, it can be inferred that his physique was very muscular due to the excessive size of his weapon, as well as the incredible size and weight of his armor.\n\nBazuso was a violent and brash man. He was greatly arrogant and seemingly viewed himself as superior to his foes, taunting those reluctant to attack him and loudly goading his enemies right in front of him. He bore an insatiable drive for combat and possessed incredible physical strength, which allowed him to easily slay anyone who challenged him. However, after Guts emerged as the victor of their duel and mortally wounded Bazuso, he attempted to yield before Guts finished him off.\n\nBazuso's strength and fighting ability became infamous throughout the battlefield. It is said that he once successfully took on over thirty men in combat, earning him the moniker of \"Thirty-Man Slayer\", and that he defeated a bear by himself, both of which were testaments to his incredible physical strength. Bazuso was strong enough to send men flying with a single swing of his battleaxe, even when using just one arm.\n\nBazuso wielded a large battleaxe during his fight against Guts. Due to his fearsome reputation, one can assume that he was very skilled in wielding it. Furthermore, the size of the battleaxe complimented Bazuso's height, giving him a wide reach in combat.\n\nPlaced in charge of a fortress under siege by a band of mercenaries, Bazuso leaves the group frozen in fear on sight, intimidated by the immense reputation of the battleaxe wielding man. As Bazuso taunts his enemies, Guts, a young independent mercenary, puts himself forward to remedy the problem; he tells his employer that he will kill Bazuso in exchange for seven pieces of gold. Though Bazuso intends to humor Guts in accepting his duel, expecting to kill the young swordsman with little effort, the ensuing battle is fought on equal terms. After an exchange of blows, Guts is fortunate enough to be able to damage Bazuso's battleaxe and deliver a powerful slash to his waist, forcing the colossal man to his knees. In his final moments, Bazuso attempts to yield for his life; Guts quickly drives his sword down into the neutralized man's head, splitting it half-way, one of Bazuso's eyes dislodged from the impact. It is Guts' triumph over Bazuso that earns him the attention of the Band of the Falcon, and more specifically, Griffith.",

When Jerome gave her a necklace of pearls, she divided them evenly among her girls, believing that they could only survive the hysteria of the heretic hunts by eliminating any cause for jealousy.   Luca took in the wayward Casca, calling the mute former Hawk commander Elaine. She covered Casca's face in bandages, pretending that Casca had contracted syphilis.    ~!When the cowardly prostitute Nina visited the nearby goat worshiping cult, and she threatened to turn Luca over to the worshipers, Luca smacked and then spanked the blond haired girl, causing her to submit. When Pepe, one of her prostitutes, was accused of heresy, Luca came to her defense. Luca and Pepe were saved from arrest by a timely appearance by Guts. When Guts discovered that Luca had seen Casca, Luca attempted to reunite him with Casca, but she could not since Nina had taken the mute girl to the cult. When Casca and Nina were taken to Mozgus, Luca bribed a guard to allow her to enter the monastery. While Guts was looking for Casca, Luca released Nina from her imprisonment. After Isidro challenged Mozgus to release Casca, one of the priest's torturers attacked, causing Luca to fall. Nina grabbed Luca and tried to hold her, but Luca let go. Luca was spared injury because she was caught by the Skull Knight. She then met the Egg of the Perfect World, who explained his purpose to her. When Albion was being overrun by monsters, Luca hid Nina in a barrel and herself in as well. As a result, Luca and Nina survived the carnage.!~",

One day, in the midst of yet another bullying, Ippo is saved by Takamura Mamoru, who happens to be a boxer. Ippo faints from his injuries and is brought to Takamura boxing gym to recover. As he regains consciousness, he is awed and amazed at his new surroundings in the gym, though lacks confidence to attempt anything. Takamura places a photo of Ippo&rsquo;s classmate on a punching bag and forces him to punch it. It is only then that Ippo feels something stir inside him and eventually asks Takamura to train him in boxing. Thinking that Ippo does not have what it takes, Takamura gives him a task deemed impossible and gives him a one week time limit. With a sudden desire to get stronger, for himself and his hard working mother, Ippo trains relentlessly to accomplish the task within the time limit.

Outside of boxing, Manabu is employed as an assistant at the Makounouchi family's fishing business. Itagaki's character is based on former world champion Oscar de La Hoya for his prodigy-like natural ability and good looks, whom Itagaki has admitted to idolizing in the manga.

He is a loud arrogant boaster who tends to refer to himself as Ore-sama (a Japanese name suffix intended for people of great importance) and he rarely ever shows a shred of consideration towards other fighters after a loss.  Takamura was discovered on the streets by Coach Kamogawa Genji, and his speed, power, and technique are all high-level to the point that he is capable of handling both In Fighters and Out Boxers without too much trouble. Unlike most characters in Hajime no Ippo, he has no special finishing blow, but every punch he has possesses killer destructive power. With the wild power to always force out any situation he claims will happen, he is a man who does everything he says he will.  As the one who got Ippo, Aoki and Kimura into boxing, he is well respected at the Kamogawa Gym. Even though he constantly looks down on and ridicules their achievements, his unrivalled strength and the few moments his true kindness leaks out prevent them from losing their respect for him. Takamura loves to pick on his fellow gym mates, with Aoki usually the first on his list. Although he tends to get more serious when hearing about or training for his next match, he still finds the time to play pranks on everyone and goof around.  The character for Taka (鷹) in his name means hawk, and as a result he is sometimes nicknamed The Japanese Hawk by announcers and spectators (most notably during his matches against Brian Hawk and David Eagle). He lives alone at the Ohta Inn apartment complex, and his room is littered with junk, old food, pornography, and even his boxing belts. His pompadour hairstyle is his trademark. ",

                    "description": "At an age swiftly approaching thirty, Date is an old-timer for a boxer but is nevertheless the man that Ippo looks up to. Years ago, he lost his World Title Match to the champion, Ricardo Martinez, who was defending his title for the 2nd time. He was knocked out in the 2nd round, and among other injuries, got a scar on the bridge of his then-fractured nose.    Date gave up boxing after that in order to settle down with his wife Aiko (a woman from a rich family who sacrificed a lot to be with him, and who just had a miscarriage at that time) and raise a family. But Date was a born boxer -- he found he could not contain his combative nature for long, and after Aiko told him that she wanted their son Yuuji to see his dad fight, he picked his career back up to the top. Date is strong in every way, but his greatest weapon is the Heartbreak Shot, a corkscrew blow to the heart that immobilizes the opponent.      ~!He is the first boxer to have defeated Ippo in the ring, making Kamogawa throw the towel.    After this fateful match, Date went after the WBA title -- a rematch with Ricardo Martinez, who was making his 18th title defense -- but lost by K.O. in the 10th round. The injuries he received in this fight included broken hands and a fractured jaw, and seriously limited Date&#039;s chances of making a return to the ring. He has, however, passed on his dream to Ippo. Currently, he trains other boxers at the Nakadai Gym. Morikawa Jouji stated in an interview that Date was modeled after former OPBF Champion Ozaki Fujio.    At the time of his retirement, Date held a record of 23-2-0 with 17 KO&#039;s. He was the former OPBF Featherweight Champion as well as a two-time JBC Featherweight Champion and has twice been the #1 contender to Ricardo Martinez&#039;s WBA Featherweight Title.!~    (Source: Wikipedia)",

Fujii is very laid back and unkept, often looking as though he just woke up. His hair is usually uncombed and he often has stubble in addition to his regular moustache. In addition to Ippo, he also seems to be friends with Takamura Mamoru and Date Eiji.   He used to be accompanied on assignments by a younger reporter, but sometime before Ippo's second match against Sendou Takeshi he gained a new partner in Iimura Mari.

He loves to tell tall tales to Chopper (who believes him blindly) or anyone who's listening. The other aspect of Usopp besides his lying is his cowardice; he is a very timid person, or so he thinks. In extremely stressful situations, Usopp has proven to be far more courageous than he believes himself to be. He shows great resolve when his friends are threatened or mocked by outsiders. Even though he is a complete coward in battle (except as his alter ego, Sogeking), he is a useful part to the Straw Hat Pirates. He is extremely handy and can fix almost anything. He sometimes sees a role model in Zoro who never seems afraid but always proud. Usopp lacks a bit of self esteem and is often taken advantage of by Nami to make her weapons or repair and improve them - something he is very adept at, having constructed the ingenious weapon \"Clima Tact.\" \n\n Usopp will also stand up and fight for not only the well-being of people, but also for their ideals - and the ideals of a pirate, which he holds very high. In battle he normally tries to trick his enemy by telling tales or mischievous lies to deceive them. Despite his lack of physical strength compared to other members of the crew, Usopp seems to be just as resilient as his comrades and this ability to bear loads and loads of damage, is one of his best traits, in addition to his cunning and intelligence, which has saved the Straw Hats on many occasions. Also, Usopp has outstanding marksmanship abilities with his slingshot and is on his way to becoming one of the best snipers in the One Piece world, although his goal in life is to become a proud and strong pirate like his father Yassop of the Red Haired Pirate Crew.",

He first appeared in the Water 7 arc. Franky is one of \"Tom's Workers\".  Franky's dream is to build a ship that would travel to the end of the Grand Line. This is the ship that the Straw Hats are currently riding, but his dream is not yet achieved until they make it to the end.  Franky usually acts tough and is quickly angered, but he is also very emotional when it comes to sad tales and often bursts into large tears, or on some occasions, plays a song. His most distinguishable personality trait is his flamboyant attitude. He frequently shouts the word 'SUPER' when he's in a positive mood, or adds it into his speech. He also has a signature pose which he uses very often.  Franky is quick to defend other people (eg. Franky Family, Nico Robin) and take action if his friends are harmed. He is also quick in making friends, allies, and comrades with even the most unlikely of individuals. Because of this, he is seen as a 'big brother' figure. Monkey D. Luffy bears similar qualities (with the exception of engaging in unnecessary fights) and because of this, despite the disputes the two had in the past, both grew to respect each other during the events of the Enies Lobby Arc.",

He has superb fighting skills that only make use of his legs, in an effort to minimize damage to his hands which would impair his cooking skills. ~!Except a single fight where he uses knives against a fellow chef.!~ Sanji uses an array of powerful and varied kicking moves when he fights. His cooking skills are world class, and he was mentored in both cooking and fighting by Chef \"Red Leg\" Zeff of the Baratie. He was born in the North Blue, but grew up in the East Blue. ~!He's also the third son of the Vinsmoke family.!~ Sanji is trash-talking and serious, and usually gruff and impatient, especially around men. This is contrasted by his \"love-cook\" side, as he is very amorous around women. Sanji is completely devoted to any beautiful woman, usually losing all common sense and composure in front of them, then attempting to comically swoon them. This behavior has earned him the nickname \"ero-cook\", or perverted cook. He can also be very chivalrous and gentlemanly around woman, volunteering to help them in various tasks and situations, whether they need help or not. He has sworn to never let insult or injury happen to any woman while he can still stand, even if that woman is trying to kill him. This is often problematic in his fighting as he can't attack female opponents, and would rather die than hurt them. All this is apparently the result of a \"strict upbringing\". To contradict his gentlemanly behavior, Sanji also enjoys seeing women wear skimpy clothing, and can be a voyeur.\n\nHis goal in life is to find the All Blue, a legendary ocean, which contains all the fish in the world. As such, it would be paradise for any cook with as much love for his work as Sanji, who holds great respect for the tools, ingredients, and art of cooking. So great is his devotion to his calling, that Sanji will not let any person or creature starve, regardless of them being friend or foe.  Being the crew's chef, he looks out for the health of his crew mates. Sanji respects Luffy as a captain, but often gets angry at him for eating too much, showing disrespect for the aesthetics of cooking, and generally being daft and irresponsible. He is constantly in petty fights with Zoro (sometimes calling him Marimo) over each others' traits and they have developed a rivalry, but have managed to make a devastating team together. He is very protective of the female crew members and Nami likes to take advantage of him, exploiting his extreme servility. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper, but has come to respect him as a crew member and friend. He's also good friends with Usopp; they team up and interact often, and Sanji understands him quite well. In short, he cares as much for the crew as any Straw Hat should, but unlike Zoro, Sanji shows these feelings more.",

He's a skilled musician (something Luffy has always wanted in his crew since the beginning), fond of playing the violin.

At first glance, Luffy does not appear to be very intelligent, often seeing things in childish manner and can easily be amazed by the simplest things. However, because he views the world in a straightforward and simple manner, he is occasionally the only person who can see past the events and see what should be done.  \n\nLuffy seems to have an unstoppable appetite, a characteristic that is common to the Japanese archetype of the (at times simple-minded) young adventurer with a heart of gold; perhaps the hunger more so in Luffy's case due to having an elastic stomach. Luffy is also another one of the several characters given the middle initial \"D\".  \n\nAlthough Luffy is fairly lightheaded and a funny character, he has an unstoppable sense of determination, optimism and commitment and will do anything to stand up for his friends and comrades. Along with that, he has great courage to back it up as well as unbelievable strength. Ever since consuming the devil fruit he was shown to be not worried about his inability to swim, much like his brother. Much of these traits are common among D's. His only display of true fear is towards his grandfather, to the point that he does not fight back and is intimidated at the mere mention of him.  \n\nLuffy never kills any of the villains, no matter how cold-hearted they are; instead, he frequently sends the villain flying, knocking them out or until the point that they are almost near death, which results in some of the villains searching for revenge, such as Buggy the Clown and Alvida. Author Eiichiro Oda explains that it's not a question of morality so much as a matter of punishing the villains for their crimes - he feels that killing the villains lets them off too lightly, whereas he considers letting them live to see their dreams be ruined a far more fitting punishment.  \n\nLuffy has a dream, and to even have a chance at achieving this dream, he says that he must find the One Piece and become King of the Pirates. He knows that to achieve his goal, he will have to defeat many strong opponents, including the World Government and his childhood hero Shanks. ",

She had a bounty of 79 million beri (One Piece currency) since she was eight years old, during an incident in which she supposedly destroyed six Buster Call ships through the use of the powers she gained by eating the Hana Hana no Mi (Flower Flower or Blooming Blooming Fruit). The fruit's power enables her to conjure up multiple replicas of her body parts (most often her arms) upon any surface she is able to see making her very powerful and dexterous as a result. Robin joined the Straw Hat Pirates after Luffy saved her life, or (how she states it) Luffy forced her to live when she wanted to die. To atone for his crime, Robin demands that Luffy allow her to join his crew, to which he complies leaving every other crew member except Sanji in shock. Although feared at first, she is quickly accepted and viewed as a comrade by the crew.  Robin is actually an archaeologist of talent and despises anyone who thoughtlessly damages any piece of history. The World Government fears her because she can decipher Poneglyphs (stones marked with glyphs from an ancient language), which contain details capable of reviving ancient weapons that have the power to destroy the world. In reality, Robin has stated that she does not care about ancient weapons and that her dream is to find the True History written on the Rio Poneglyph.  Robin is a mysterious and serious person who appears quiet and reclusive, and the wisest in the Straw Hat's Crew. She was thought by those around her to be cold and mean, but it was proven that she is actually a kind person who always thinks before she acts. She often only speaks when something interesting or important has happened. She loves to study history, and the comfort and freedom to study and read. She is also quick to point out gross or realistically morbid facts, often creeping out Nami or Usopp. Robin is the wisest and most sensible member of the crew. She has a vast knowledge of the seas and the world and usually keeps her head during surprising situations, allowing her to logically analyze the situation without losing her cool. This trait makes her different from the other Straw Hats, who often comically react melodramatically to unexpected happenings and hold irrational ideas and conclusions. Despite her attempts to keep herself distant, Robin has fallen for her new friends and has taken the role of the distant den mother.",

Zoro is a skilled swordsman who fights with his own unique sword style known as santoryu (three katana fighting style). This is achieved by using one katana in each hand, and another in his mouth. He is also seen fighting with only one or two swords. When in a serious fight he ties his normally, tied on the arm bandana, on his head.   \n\nThough not a samurai, he appears to maintain a certain degree of bushido, and is frequently mistaken for one. Unlike Luffy and most of the other Straw Hat pirates, Zoro has been known to kill his opponents if he has to, though never in cold blood. Zoro has a stern, serious and distanced personality, but unlike Robin he often reacts in a goofy and exaggerated comic style due to his gruff, impatient attitude. On the ship, he normally either trains with weights or sleeps. The only work he is seen doing regularly is hoisting the anchor using his great strength. He also likes sake, almost to the degree that Luffy likes meat, but like Nami, he never gets drunk due to his inhumanly-high endurance and tolerance for alcohol. Another notable trait is his lack of orientation, as Zoro often gets lost, even in small, familiar spaces or when being led by someone. Despite this, he is often the first to sense an enemy or danger, and the first to react. He is often displayed being well aware of dangerous situations and people around him.  Zoro often also reminds others of the harsh facts, which often shocks some of the other crew members, although they usually decide he is right. Zoro has also stated that he is an atheist, and has never believed in anything except himself. He often comes across as arrogant and overconfident, but only because he knows he's a strong man with great fighting ability. Even so, Zoro knows that he still has a lot of untapped potential, and is constantly seen training and trying to improve his fighting skills. He also adheres to a strict sword master's code of honor, and never falsely brags or lies about his abilities, sometimes outright admitting a weakness, even to an enemy. He also never tries to escape from a fight or use trickery to win, believing that doing so is cowardly and scorning anyone who uses such tactics. Zoro is very vigorous, strong-willed, and determined.",

He also still has distrust in humankind because of events his youth, where he was treated as a brutal monster. He will often outright insult a human who compliments him while smiling, dancing, and being obviously pleased. He also shows a certain interest in books, but mostly medicine related ones.  Chopper is more or less on a journey to define himself, seeing almost anybody on his crew as a role model. This, combined with his naiveness, often causes him to imitate the other Straw Hats' actions, no matter how obviously silly. Because of this, he often gets involved in the crazy antics of Luffy and Usopp, wholeheartedly believing that what they are doing is sensible and fun. Chopper is one of the most innocent Straw Hat Pirates, and is also very naive, resulting in a tendency to believe anything told to him, even the outrageously fictitious and exaggerated lies of Usopp. Sanji originally wanted to cook Chopper and continues to refer to him as \"the emergency food supply\" to tease him but considers him a friend. Although he is the crew's doctor he wasn't originally hired by Luffy for that purpose. But actually, in Luffy's words, for being  \"cool reindeer that can transform\".",

He was the pirate captain of the all fishman crew, the Arlong Pirates, a former member of the Sun Pirates, and the older brother of Madam Shyarly. He is known for being the main villain in the Arlong Arc and had the highest bounty in East Blue before being defeated by Monkey D. Luffy. Like many other One Piece characters, he has his own unique laugh, which is \"Shahahahaha.\"\n\nArlong considers humans to be inferior beings and is very cruel to them. He is keen to separate his race from humans, and has the mentality that his people are superior to humans in every way. He thinks nothing of killing a town full of humans, although he seems to prefer controlling people with money and deals.  He has an eye for spotting exploitable talent that he can use for his goals and is an excellent planner. He spent eight years using Nami and her maps to plan his takeover of the East Blue. Nevertheless, any promise about money he makes, he keeps.

To help him, he developed an incredible memory: he is able to memorize every single aspect of something he saw, but he commented (in chapter 101) that he could identify \"the key\" (the key which Tyki Mikk gave) faster if he were to use both his eyes when sieving out the real \"key\" from the fake. He is 18 years old, and normally uses his left eye while the right eye is covered by an eye-patch. \n\nHis anti-Akuma weapon is a size-shifting hammer, which he calls Ōzuchi Kozuchi (大槌小槌, lit. \"big hammer small hammer\") or Nyoibo. It can grow (満, man) or extend (伸, shin). The weight increases with its size, but since Lavi is the conformer, the weight does not effect him; however, it does to everyone else. His hammer can also summon several \"judgments\" with kanji possibly representing the classical elements that can be used individually or combined. However, between some of the seals are question marks. This probably means that Lavi has some seals that he has yet to learn from his Innocence. His techniques so far, are: Hi Ban: Gouka Kaijin (劫火灰燼 火判, lit. Fire Seal: Conflagration of Ash): using the fire seal to create a torrent of flames with the form of a snake; Ten Ban: Raitei Kaiten (雷霆回天 天判, lit. Heaven Seal: Thundering Lightning Whirling in the Skies): using the heaven seal to liberate an immense lightning; Moku Ban: Tenchi Bankai (天地盤回 木判, lit. Wood Seal: Roots Entwining Heaven and Earth): using the wood seal to control objects in nature; Konbo Ban: Gouraiten (コンボ判 剛雷天, lit. Combo Seal: Strong Thunder of the Heavens): using both fire and heaven seals to create a huge snake of fire and iron. Also making a shield-like flame wall.\n\nIt was shown when Bookman told Lavi to use the wood seal to clear the clouds (Three Akuma were hiding behind the clouds). Lavi stated that he forgot he could use it to affect nature directly, and as he remembered it the question mark turned into a kanji that he used right away. If seen more carefully the kanji for the wood seal can be seen throughout the manga whenever Lavi summons his seals long before the use of the actual seal itself (e.g. during the use of the heaven seal). At the moment just before its first use the seal can be seen just behind Lavi's head and had never transformed from a question mark in the first place.  The marks of water and earth also appear among his seals. He likes to call Bookman \"Panda\" due to the thick black circles around his eyes; a converted Akuma \"Chomesuke\"; and Arystar Krory\"Kuro-chan\" in the anime and \"Kro-chan\" in the manga. He is the only character other than General Tiedoll to call Kanda by his given name (that name being Yuu, also translated as Yū or Yuu), and apparently speaks to him outside of missions, a fact that was shown when he called Allen \"beansprout\" (moyashi), saying that if Kanda could call him that, Lavi could as well, as he is the same age as Kanda. He has a habit of teasing Allen, and deems himself as his big brother. A recurring gag in the series is Lavi's fondness for beautiful older women, whenever he sees a woman his type (Example: Eliade) he'll yell out \"Strike!\" with hearts in his eye. \n\n~!In recent chapters (beginning with 114), Lavi was fighting an incarnation of his past created by Road in one of her dimensions. It was revealed that his name, Lavi, is just an alias (his 49th, to be exact). He had cast aside his old name and background to show his commitment to being a Bookman. It was also revealed that Lavi was once cold and indifferent to others, for a Bookman only lives to view and record history and that humans are nothing more than 'ink' on a page. However, over time Lavi's personality changed and he began to truly care about others, slowly casting aside his identity as a Bookman. When he thought that Allen was killed by Tyki Mikk, he tried to avenge Allen by attempting to kill Tyki himself.  During his fight against his past incarnation, his 'heart' (current personality) was supposedly destroyed. This caused his past incarnation, under the control of Road, to emerge in his physical body and savagely attack Allen. Unwilling to hurt Lavi, Allen attacked Road but failed to harm her, as her current body was not her true form. Lavi's current self managed to resurface and suppress his past self. He then engulfed himself in a massive Hi-Ban to attack Road in the real world, while simultaneously stabbing her through the heart within her dimension, defeating her.  In recent chapters, after the appearance of Cross Marian to their aid, Lavi's status was unknown after falling into a 'hole' made by the Millennium Earl's flashy entrance. He attempted to lengthen his Innocence to save himself, but it shattered when Allen grabbed Lavi's Innocence in an effort to pull him up. Although he was apparently lost in the 'hole' in the Ark, he was shown to have been revived along with the rest of the 'lost' Exorcists on the Ark when the Ark was restored by Allen. He is now back at Black Order HQ waiting for his Innocence to be fixed. When Lulubell and her Akuma attack the HQ, he is unable to assist Allen as he cannot activate his (shattered) hammer. When the level four akuma attacked Komui and the others, he and Kanda both act as a distraction in order for Lenalee to quickly create her newly formed innocence.!~ \n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

                    "description": " __Height:__ 177cm (5'9\")\n \nKanda Yu is a main protagonist character and member of the fictional religious organization known as the Black Order, in the anime and manga series D.Gray-man, by Katsura Hoshino.  Kanda is a young and handsome Japanese man usually found in any mood that isn't positive. Kanda has long black hair (dark blue in the anime), which the mangaka notes that he uses soap to wash. Lavi comments that Kanda is a \"pretty-type character\", and Allen occasionally calls him \"feminine face\". He also has been commented that he has \"dark eyes\" by the head of the Asian branch (9 years ago) and he has blue eyes in the manga. Kanda seems to be conceited over his hair.   \n\n~~~ __Personality__~~~  Kanda comes across as cold, stoic, and arrogant, even to his fellow exorcists. In battle he will do anything to win, sometimes at the risk of his teammates. He once made a sarcastic joke about leaving them to die. It is his opinion that exorcists are not saviors.  Yu, or Yuu, is Kanda's given name, though he dislikes being called by it or even introducing himself as such. He calls Allen \"bean sprout\" (モヤシ, moyashi, English Dub: \"Short Stack\"). Kanda seems to know Lavi, though he doesn't hesitate with his usual threats if Lavi calls Kanda by his given name. However, it is clear that Kanda does care for his fellow Exorcists and the Finders (whom he claims not to care about).  He tends to mask his emotions and often claims, \"It's none of my business.\" In spite of his intentions, he and Allen are often at each other's throats and rarely see eye-to-eye on anything.   ~!Kanda's personality seems not to have changed since he was young. At age 9, he was moody and easily annoyed, especially towards another 'second exorcist', Alma Karma, who often followed him around. However, his final conflict with Alma seems to have hardened him further, for, though he was seen laughing with Alma as a child, no such display of frivolity has been witnessed since then.!~ Kanda's favorite foods are soba noodles and tempura (especially pumpkin, shishitou [a small, sweet green pepper], and lotus root). Kanda dislikes many things, to the point that \"there are too many to write down\". However, Kanda himself points out that he hates people with naive personalities, people who don't keep their promises, cursed people, people who can't keep their mouths shut, people who call him by his given name, and \"sweet things\".   \n\n ~~~ __History__~~~   ~!Kanda was originally an Innocence accomodator and exorcist of the Black Order, but he was killed by an Akuma. There was also a woman in his life whom he loved.  Kanda is \"reborn\" a second generation exorcist created by the order 9 years previous to the current events of the story through the efforts of the Epstain and Chang families. His body was modified to heal incredibly quickly in order to sustain synchronization tests. He regularly underwent a shockingly cruel and painful procedure to force them to be able to synchronize with his Innocence, literally tearing him apart in the process. Due to his second exorcist strength and ability to regenerate, the procedure was repeated even after he had 'died' several times. Although initially extremely hostile towards Alma Karma, another child of the second exorcist program, the two eventually become close friends due to their shared experience at the hands of the Order.  Yu begins seeing an illusion of a woman who Alma initially assumes is Fou, the guardian deity of the Asia branch since she had appeared to Alma whilst he was distressed following syncro-testing. He also starts to dream of her and of his death at the hands of an Akuma. The Order realize this and decide that they should terminate Yu from the program. Alma hears this conversation and rescues Yu although he is captured by CROW guards in the process.  After landing in a sewer he is washed up in front of a younger Bak Chan and Noise Marie. Eventually after a brief exchange Kanda was taken by the members of CROW to be \"terminated\" for learning the truth about the Second Exorcist program. The \"procedure\" proves a failure as Kanda's past memories of an unknown woman reanimate him and allow him to summon the Innocence of Mugen in a sword form which he uses to free himself. As he is escaping he finds an injured Marie and while examining his wound, his blood starts to heal Marie. Kanda decides to take Marie with him in his search of Alma but upon finding him discovers that Alma has killed the staff of the Asian Branch and the members of CROW with his own newly-acquired Innocence. A battle ensues between a psychotic Alma and Kanda resulting in Yu's arm being cut off. As Alma explains his reasons for murdering everyone he attacks Marie and impales Kanda, leading him to find the resolve to deal a menacing blow to Alma.  \n\n ~~~ __Abilities__~~~  Kanda can recover much faster than ordinary humans and able to withstand the blood of Akuma due to a secret skill created by the Chang family, he is also seen being able to rebirth after death \"approximately during 580 seconds\", reproduce falling limbs, and have an abnormal physical strength.!~   \n\n~~~ __Innocence__~~~  \"Mugen\" (六幻,Six Illusions). Kanda has a sword with supernatural powers. He runs his index and middle finger through the back of the blade to activate it, whilst saying Mugen Unsheathe, Innocence Activate, which turns the blade silver. The Shape of the sword has changed throughout Kanda's Timeline, during his childhood, it takes the form of a small butcher blade with multiple small wings on the hilt, upon Kanda's introduction in the beginning of the series, it took the form of a chokuto (a straight Japanese sword without a tsuba) with a black cross-emblazoned hilt and sheath, but after his battle with Skin Boric, it was reforged into a traditional Katana.   ~!    •  __Kaichū: Ichigen__ (界蟲「一幻」 English dub: Underworld Creatures, First Illusion, lit. Hell's Insects: First Illusion): Kanda swings his sword and releases a small swarm of supernatural creatures that devour his opponents.     •  __Nigentou__ (二幻刀, lit. Double Illusion Blades): Kanda covers his sword and scabbard in a coat of energy and generates an energy blade, creating two impossibly sharp weapons. The second blade that he creates over his scabbard can also be just a pure energy blade if the scabbard is not used.           •  __Hakka Tourou__ (八花蟷螂, lit. Eight Flowers Praying Mantis): Using Nigentou, Kanda quickly slashes the enemy eight times. The slashes collectively resemble a flower.      •  __Shouka__ (昇華, lit. Sublimate): Kanda activates the power of his tattoo, and his pupil changes into three dots. Veins also rise around his eyes. Once Shouka is activated, Kanda can activate Sangenshiki.           •  __Sangenshiki__ (禁忌 「三幻式」, lit. Three Illusions): Kanda drastically increases his speed and strength at the cost of some of his life.               •  __Consume, Mugen:__ Kanda reconstructs a broken Mugen by reconnecting the pieces with energy. Mugen appears to fall apart after one slash, however.               •  __Bakuhakuzan__ (爆魄斬, lit. Explosive Spirit Slash): Kanda needs Sangenshiki to be active to use this, and makes a slash that seems to create small explosions and is strong enough to cut through a Level 4 Akuma. Kanda can also use it with the Fifth Illusion Style.      •  __Fourth Illusion Style:__ Kanda's Pupil changes to four dots and he gains another drastic increase in speed and power.      •  __Fifth Illusion Style:__ Kanda's hair changes to a shade of light purple and stands up straight, while Mugen's blade glows with a different color and emanates large amounts of electricity. It uses a large amount of Kanda's life. The effects of this sword also seems to give Kanda a need for destruction while sealing up the rest of his emotions leaving only his anger. When he uses the maximum power of the fifth illusion style, the sword takes the same form as when he was child (small butcher blade with multiple small wings on the hilt).          •  __Ripping Flash Claw:__ Kanda unleashes seven sharp energy beams.!~   \n(Source: D.Gray-Man Wikia)",

Her parents were killed by an Akuma when she was very young. Because she is an Accommodator, the Black Order took her away from her only remaining family member (Komui) to Headquarters against her will. For three years she was never allowed to leave the place, which felt like a prison to her. Because she attempted suicide, she had to be restrained and tied to her bed. However, once Komui joined the Black Order, Lenalee became more at ease in the Black Order. She once told Allen that her \"world\" consists of her friends and family; if something terrible ever happened to them, she would be devastated.  She is an Exorcist whose anti-Akuma weapon is a pair of boots, \"Dark Boots\". That, when invoked increases one's speed and strength greatly in the legs. Aside from being able to have great speed, she can also fly with her boots.\n\n __Manga Spoilers:__  ~! In chapter 153 she made a promise with her innocence so it would become stronger to protect everything she loves, and so it liquified and fused with her blood, creating a better version of her Dark Boots. After defeating the Level 4 Akuma, the boots transformed into a red ring that stays on her legs until the innocence is activated.  She is the first known exorcist to create this new type of innocence named \"Crystal Type\". However, it has come to mind that after the battle, her innocence may be the heart of the innocence.!~",

He was abandoned by his biological parents because of the supposed \"deformity\" of his left arm (which was later revealed to be caused by his Innocence). He was eventually found and adopted by a traveling performer named Mana Walker on Christmas Day. Some time later Mana died, and Allen, tormented with grief and manipulated by the Millennium Earl, turned Mana into an Akuma, hoping that his beloved surrogate father would be fully resurrected. But the Mana Akuma cursed Allen and sliced through his left eye, leaving the \"Pentacle\" — the mark of the Akuma — which scars the left side of his face. This enabled his left eye to see the souls trapped within the Akuma from then on. It was at this same moment that Allen's left arm first invoked as an Anti-Akuma weapon, which instinctively destroyed the Mana Akuma. During the course of this traumatic event, Allen's hair turned from brown into a stark white.  \n\nAllen eventually meets Cross Marian, a General of the Black Order, who explained to Allen the ways of the Akuma and the trapped souls within them: Once a soul becomes trapped inside an Akuma, they are trapped forever; and that the only way to save one is to exorcise them from their Akuma vessel. Allen subsequently became Cross' disciple and spent the next three years with him before being sent to the Black Order to become an official exorcist. During this time, Allen was tormented by his master's constant irresponsible behavior and forced into various odd-jobs to pay off the debts that General Cross accumulated. This, coupled with Marian's womanizing ways and harsh treatment towards Allen, led to Walker fearing more than respecting his master whom he never speaks fondly of. \n\n~!In fact, when Jasdevi claims that Cross is like a demon, Allen denies this and instead insists that Cross is a real demon. In addition, when Jasdevi reveal that the debts Cross left to them total about 2 million yen, Allen grows demon horns, laughs at them, and calls their debts small change in comparison to his own, leaving Lavi to wonder just how much money Allen's been made to pay.  In addition to being physically fit and skilled at combat (as evident by his ability to fight and dodge Fou without the use of his Innocence), Allen has a few odd talents and skills. Because of the many debts Allen was forced into paying by Cross, he learned to play cards and gamble at a very young age, though his initial purpose was to practice his numb deformed left hand. He also learned how to cheat and win through deception and doesn't hesitate to use these tactics whenever necessary. In fact, he is quite proud of his talents. This is a stark contrast to his polite and courteous nature and often surprises his friends who wouldn't expect such a dark side to Allen and has caused them to wonder just what Cross has done to him. Walker also possesses circus abilities such as juggling and acrobatics, which he learned from traveling with Mana who was himself a circus clown by trade.!~\n\n~!Inspector Levrier and Cross have both referred to a \"player\" (as in one who plays a musical instrument), and Cross has hinted that there may be more than one.  Allen's synchronization ratio reached a maximum of 83% before having his Innocence destroyed by Tyki. Yet unknown to Allen, the Innocence lingered around as a hazy fog of particles; at the time, a direct reflection of his shattered state of mind. It wasn't until he came to an epiphany that he was able to seize control of his Anti-Akuma weapon once again and achieving his Innocence's true, fully-invoked form. When not activated, his arm is black and meets with his shoulder in a spiraling pattern that ends with tattoo-like emblem. Following this, the Order gave it the official designation of Crowned Clown (神ノ道化（クラウン・クラウン）, Kuraun Kuraun), due to its jester-like appearance when invoked. The kanji used in the name literally translates to God's Clown (神ノ道化, Kami no Douke). !~\n\n~!When invoked, Crowned Clown acts as a body-armored Innocence, forming a white-hooded cowl and sleeve of Innocence energy which covers his shoulders and right arm, while his left arm and hand become slender and black, clad in armor and razor sharp claws. A masquerade-style mask is always affixed to the cowl, which takes on various configurations and appearances. This transformation also changes Allen's usual hairstyle from flat to a spiky rear. As before, his Innocence possesses a certain degree of sentience, but as Crowned Crown is able to manipulate Allen's entire body like a marionette when incapacitated, or simply assisting in evasive tactics.!~",

Originally appeared at the Noah Dinner Party with the first few revealed Noah.    She recently appeared in the manga again. Disguised as Andrew Nansen, she infiltrated the Order&#039;s headquarters to lead an invasion of a horde of Akuma after Allen and his friends&#039; hard struggle in the Ark. She plans to re-obtain the &quot;egg&quot; and create Skulls out of the most intelligent scientists of the Black Order. After seeing Allen, she also decides to bring him to the Earl to fill the spot of the 14th. Unfortunately for her, the generals of the Black Order, Cross Marian, Cloud Nine and Winters Sokaro, have proven to be far too powerful for Lulu Bell and her high-ranking Akuma to handle. In the end, she tried to escape with the egg, but Allen was onboard and destroyed the egg, causing a massive explosion. Whether Lulu Bell survived the explosion or not is currently unknown.    Lulu Bell represents the &quot;Lust&quot; of Noah with the power of &quot;Form&quot;.    In the anime adaptation, she often turns herself into a black cat to hide in the shadows or for spy purposes. She has cat-like qualities as well in her human form (for example, she licks her plate while drinking milk).    One of her main abilities as a Noah is the metamorphosis, in which she can transform herself into anyone or anything. She is not limited to a solid form, as she has been shown to transform into both humans for impersonation or water. She is especially deadly in liquid form as many attacks pass right through her. She has also been shown to turn her hands into whip-like tentacles, which she can use to pierce, strike, or slice. She is also able to affect Innocence to a certain degree. When Allen was sneak attacked by one of the Combined Akuma, he was temporarily weakened, which allowed Lulubell to negate Crown Clown with a slap.",

He is a sorcerer from long ago, and he plans to lead the world to its destruction. Some time in the past he formed an alliance with the Noah Clan, who call him \"Duke Millennium\"(Except Road who calls him Millenie). Hoshino says she based the Earl of Millennium off a legendary alchemist/preacher (most likely the Count of St Germain or Nicolas Flamel, though in many ways he also reminiscent of Dorian Gray, possibly referenced in \"Dorian Grey man\" and thus \"D.Gray-Man\", as adapted in the film The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) whose tale even claims he still may be alive somewhere.  In appearance, the Earl resembles a grotesque caricature of a Victorian gentleman -- a rotund figure in cape and top hat, with an enormous grin that remains fixed even when he is speaking and even eating, and his eyes permanently hidden behind a pair of pince-nez spectacles. In the manga, almost every one of his lines of dialog ends with a heart.In the anime, he invariably uses polite Japanese. Throughout the story, he displays two different personalities. The first is his normal cheerful, friendly, and happy attitude, almost like a friendly old uncle. With the Noah, he's a member of the family, and is particularly playful and affectionate towards Road. His other personality is one of sheer, sadistic malice, capable of happily playing with people's lives.  He wears a different hat in each encounter, each with a different decoration. In a gag comic in Volume 2 of the manga, he is shown taking off his hat, and having another set of ears. His main form of combat involves his umbrella Relo. He has also shown the ability to create massive explosions of dark energy. The Earl is also able to summon a large black sword that is the opposite of Allen's Crown Clown sword.",

Partially free from the Earl's orders, she became a loyal follower of Marian and was with him in Edo. She was sent by Cross to deliver a message to Lenalee and company and to lead them safely to Edo. Even so, the Earl's will still had some influence on the converted Akuma's minds, making them suffer greatly if they tried to reject their Akuma nature. Sachiko liked to end her phrases with \"-cho\" so Lavi nicknamed her \"Chomesuke\". Sachiko's abilities are unknown, although she has great strength (as seen when she uses this ability to push Anita's boat). She was destroyed in episode 72 by streams of dark energy from a combined akuma. Before she died, she thanked Lavi. ",

She has a &quot;tough-love&quot; attitude, particularly towards Allen. While she was training Allen in an attempt to bring back his Innocence, she would attack without mercy with the hope that he would activate his left arm. When Allen was feeling down, she would appear in front of him as someone else (eg:Lou Fa (this way she could show her soft side without Allen knowing).    She shares a strong bond with Bak even though she loves to tease him. She can manipulate her form in order to change her hands into axe-like weapons or to copy someone's appearance. She is also capable of communicating telepathically with others. The Headquarters of the Asia Branch is protected by a very strong barrier created by Fou (who is the &quot;entrance&quot; of the barrier). Under her tough shell Fou is a very caring individual and is quite willing to give up her life for the sake of those she loves. She took Allen's form to face the level 3 Akuma, in order to buy the real Allen time to escape. Just before they began to fight, she said to herself &quot;Bye bye, Bak.&quot; She was hurt badly in the battle, but after Allen defeated the Akuma she is shown to be recovering.

He dresses in bandages, which cover up a mass number of holes throughout his body.  Nen Ability ~! Batte Le Cantabile He plays music through the holes on his skin during battle, with different songs creating different nen effects, such as transformation of his own body or the materialization of objects. He is from the Gyudondondo tribe, and when the boys from this tribe are 3 years old, needles are poked into their body. These needles are slowly replaced with bigger needles, and eventually sticks, until holes in the skin are created. The people of this tribe are called \"dancing warriors\", perhaps ascribing to the different sounds that are created depending on the holes. There are two different phases to his nen: The prologue and the Jupiter. The Prologue phase allows him to materialize a warrior to attack for him. The Jupiter phase allows him to materialize a giant boulder and crush his enemies.!~",

A gourmand, he was frequently in trouble at the shrine for stealing food between meals (insisting that he couldn&#039;t wait until dinner), and is also a competent cook. It was prophesied that he would protect Kamui with his life, but that he would die for a woman; the first time he meets Arashi, he decides she will be the one. An incessantly friendly young man, he wears down the resistance of both Kamui and Arashi and worms his way into their affections, despite their initial coldness and his own unrefined Kansai dialect.    In addition to generating powerful electrical discharges, he is also capable of calling upon a gohōdōji, a magical being similar to a shikigami manifesting as a massive, hideous ghostly creature. It is psychically linked to Sorata, allowing him to spy on others and act at a distance from himself, but he suffers any damage inflicted upon it.     __In Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle__   ~!

                    "description": "Subaru was born in Kyoto on 19 February 1974, the younger of a pair of fraternal twins, his older twin being a girl named Hokuto. Their parents (who are never seen) were members of the Sumeragi, a clan of onmyouji who have served Japan and its emperors for hundreds of years. Subaru was trained from an early age to become the 13th head of the Sumeragi clan, replacing his grandmother. At the age of nine, he was separated from his sister Hokuto for a year of intensive training in Tokyo. On the day he ascended to the head of the clan, Subaru encountered a strange young man under a cherry tree. The meeting would subsequently be expunged from his memory. Subaru's grandmother ordered him to wear gloves from that day onwards, and never to allow anyone else to see his hands. The old onmyouji cast a spell that would repel any attempts by others to remove them. Subaru never removed his gloves, and was known to wear them even when sleeping.  Appearances:  ~!  __Tokyo Babylon__ By 1991, Subaru had grown into a cheerful yet bashful teenager, utterly devoted to helping others -- both in his capacity as Japan's most powerful onmyouji and in \"normal\" life. As well as exorcizing demons, helping lost souls ascend to the afterlife, entering the minds of comatose people to bring them back to the world, and fighting those who abused spiritual powers, he would often also stand up to bullies and provide comfort and friendship to their victims.  Subaru lives in an apartment in Tokyo, in the same building as his sister Hokuto, whose personality had become the polar opposite to his own -- eccentric and outgoing. Hokuto is vexed by her brother's selflessness, encouraging him to think of himself once in a while, rather than placing the good of others above himself. Although she encourages him to be cheerful and polite, she also criticizes his excessive deference to others, including his habit of bowing to people on the phone \"like a salaryman\". Subaru wears effeminate costumes designed by his sister, her own outfits being even more outlandish.  Subaru and Hokuto are good friends with a kindly and magically-aware veterinarian named Seishirou Sakurazuka, who they met at a railway station after Subaru's shikigami led him on a bizarre chase. Seishirou acts as guardian to both and claims to love Subaru romantically. Subaru is frequently embarrassed by these claims, as well as Hokuto's gleeful attempts to bring the two together, but gradually grows to accept the older man's apparent love.  During Tokyo Babylon, Subaru has dreams of the day he became the head of the Sumeragi clan: he recalls the strange meeting beneath a cherry tree unseasonably in bloom, with a young man who told him the Japanese folk tale that every cherry tree has a corpse buried beneath it, whose blood dyes the white blossoms pink. When the 9-year-old Subaru asked if the buried people were in pain, the young man, initially confused but becoming oddly amused, made a bet with him, the only words of which he heard were: \"If ever we meet again...\" and \"...but today... I will let you go.\" Recalling this dream, Subaru begins to wonder if the sinister young man is actually Seishirou, despite the different personality shown between the two. He also ponders Hokuto's suggestions that Seishirou's surname links him to the Sakurazukamori, a ruthless magical assassin clan, but dismisses it due to Seishirou's kind nature.  After Seishirou loses the sight in his right eye protecting Subaru, the onmyoji realizes he loves the man. Unfortunately for Subaru, Seishirou reveals that he is indeed the Sakurazukamori, raised to be incapable of either love or hate. Lifting the veil he had placed on the boy's memory, Seishirou states the nature of the bet he had made: that if they met again, he would live with the boy for a year to see if his heart could be moved. However, the assassin claims he was as barren of emotion as ever, and attempts to kill Subaru, only for the boy's grandmother to rescue him at great personal cost. Subaru becomes catatonic as a result, but recovers when, telepathically, he senses Hokuto's self-sacrifice to the Sakurazukamori.  Subaru decides at this point to drop out of school so that he can focus on training. He continues his work as an onmyouji, remaining compassionate to others but acting more reserved; he also takes up smoking, like Seishirou before him.   __X__ By the time of X/1999, Subaru is his twenties, continuing his work as an onmyouji under direction from his grandmother. Although he is recognized to be one of the Dragons of Heaven, and thus capable of creating a kekkai (spiritual barrier) - star-shaped in his case - to protect others during his battles, he has no interest in the fate of humanity; his only concern is to settle his score with Seishirou. However, with persuasion from Sorata Arisugawa and Arashi Kishū, he joins the other members of the group in Tokyo. One of his first acts is to bring Kamui Shirou out of the catatonia into which he had fallen after seeing his childhood sweetheart, Kotori Monou, killed by her brother Fūma. Subaru and Kamui develop a close friendship based on their similar hardships, with Subaru acting as a mentor to Kamui during his further trials. Series creators Clamp, jokingly, refer to Kamui and Subaru's relationship as \"sisterly\".  Subaru faces Seishirou several times, but each time, though defeated, is allowed to live; he begin to imagine that the assassin does not consider him \"worth\" killing. When Subaru faces Fūma in battle, he sees the younger man as Seishirou, and allows the Dragon of Earth to blind him in his right eye -- a lesser wish Subaru had held for some time. However, in single combat against Seishirou at Rainbow Bridge, Subaru reveals his true desire: he no longer wished to kill Seishirou (having tried unsuccessfully to eradicate his feelings for the man), but instead wished to be killed by him, as thus he would exist in Seishirou's heart, even if it was only as \"another victim of the cherry blossom\". However, due to a spell cast by Hokuto at her death, the killing strike (a \"spearhand\" stab through the heart) is reversed, and Subaru kills Seishirou instead. The assassin's last words to Subaru -- which are not fully stated to the audience -- have a profound effect on the young man, being something he had not expected.  From this point, the manga and TV series differ. In the manga, following Seishirou's death, Subaru is slated to become the next Sakurazukamori, for the ritual of succession for Sakurazukamori is to kill their predecessor. Seishirou wished for Subaru to erase the mark another man had left on him. As such, Fuma gave Subaru Seishirou's eye, which he states was the only thing of his he could find at Rainbow Bridge, to replace the one the young man lost. This act completes this ritual and, after regaining his full sight, Subaru becomes the Sakurazukamori and one of the Dragons of Earth. Since he has lost the one person he wished to protect, he is rendered unable to create a kekkai any longer. His fate beyond this is unknown as the manga remains incomplete.  In the TV series, his status as Sakurazukamori is not directly alluded to. Instead, Subaru sinks back into a catatonic state, urging Kamui to look to his own wish and advising him that \"it is impossible for everyone to be happy\". He is, as in the manga, unable to create a kekkai, having lost the one person in the world for whom he truly cared. However, in the final episode, the rebellious Dragon of Earth dreamseer Kakyou Kuzuki allows the spirit of Hokuto to cross into Subaru's mind, to convince him to continue the fight; Subaru realizes he cares for Kamui, and joins his final battle against Fūma, protecting him from a fatal strike. Before his apparent death, Subaru urges Kamui to realize his wish. Thus, Kamui sacrifices himself to bring Fūma back to his original, kind-hearted personality and save humanity from destruction; as a side effect, Subaru is revived and lives on.   __Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle__ Subaru reappears as one of a pair of twin vampires (the other being Kamui Shirou) for whom Seishirou Sakurazuka is searching. A correlation is also shown in Subaru's relationship with Seishiro, for he seems worried about him when he asks Fuuma how he is doing in the Tokyo arc. Also, though Kamui appears to have an intense hatred for Seishiro, Subaru is much more lax about their situation of being chased and seems to silently disagree with his twin.  He makes his first appearance in the Tokyo arc, in which he talks to a comatose Sakura and urges her to wake up before she is lost to her dreams. It turns out that he himself was left in a comatose state at the bottom of a large water reservoir, leading to Kamui's fierce protection of the site, particularly from Fuuma. Eventually he wakes and is at last rejoined with his twin.   __xxxHolic__ In volume one, Yūko Ichihara mentions knowing an onmyouji with a twin sister whom she has known since the onmyouji was very young. She hopes that the boy will be happy, but there are many definitions for happiness. This onmyouji is Subaru.!~ (Source: Wikipedia)",

Despite his raw sexual charisma, Takumi can also be a cold and controlling workaholic. His favorite brand of cigarettes is Gitanes.    ~!Coming from a family with an alcoholic and bitter father, he and his older sister learned to be independent at a young age due to their mother being bed-ridden with illness in the hospital. He looked after Layla since they were children and always harbored a brother-like care for her. He ends up dating and sleeping with Hachi, which dubiously resulted in Hachi's pregnancy. For some reason, perhaps because of his family background or because he is starting to become possessive, he refuses to leave Hachi and the unborn child despite Hachi's uncertainty whether it is his or Nobu's. In a previous chapter, Naoki said something to Yasu about Takumi not letting the woman he is infatuated with run away that easily; and Ren saying that Takumi hates getting into such mess, which hints that Takumi took responsibility not just only because of sheer sense of responsibility but he is starting to care for her. But although he loves Hachi and is \"infatuated\" with her, Takumi still keeps his playboy habits, cheating on her first with a soap-opera actress and later on with Reira, who has openly declared her desire to become his lover.  In the end, Takumi is one of the most confusing characters in this manga. Like what Hachiko once said, with Takumi, it is hard to tell whether it is love or business.!~",

He is a former student of Shichisei Gakuen (often translated as Academy of Seven Voices), a school for fighters where Ritsu Minami was his teacher.  As ordered, Soubi contacted Ritsuka after Seimei&#039;s death. He introduced Ritsuka to the world of fighters and sacrifices, and told Ritsuka he would be his fighter. Although Soubi&#039;s &quot;true name&quot; is Beloved and Ritsuka&#039;s is Loveless, they fight as a pair, which is considered taboo. There is also a severe loss of strength, and in Soubi&#039;s case, his marking bleeds in battle. Since meeting Ritsuka, Soubi doesn&#039;t operate under the Beloved name, and effectively abandoned it altogether.  Soubi appears to know much more about Seimei and his cause of death than he will divulge. Despite Ritsuka&#039;s insistence that he tell him everything he knows, Soubi refuses. In volume 4 of the manga, he even says, &quot;Seimei is my God.&quot; He openly declares that he lives his life by Seimei&#039;s orders, but still says he obeys Ritsuka&#039;s every order.  Many readers and characters in the story itself label Soubi as a masochist. He is extremely contradictory, and says conflicting things on pain and control, making his true feelings unclear. A popular theory among readers is that Soubi is selective, and only desires punishment from those he deems worthy and strong such as Seimei and Ritsuka. In support of this theory, Soubi shuns Ritsu&#039;s offers to control his life.  In addition to the masochist label, Soubi is often described as having a shotacon complex. Despite the clamor to label him as such, it is also claimed by some there is no evidence of this within the canon. Though, at least in the anime, it must be noted that Soubi is recurrently fondling and kissing the 12-year-old Ritsuka. It is difficult to explain the sexual connotations of their behaviour without resorting to a shotacon-relationship; at the very least one can say their relationship is sexually ambiguous. Whether this is part of a broader complex, is unknown, though in the anime, Soubi also showed a certain infatuation with the male Zero&#039;s.   ~!In the latest Zero-Sum Magezine chapters, Soubi has been revealed to be the Beloved spell fighter imposter. Ritsu referred to Soubi as a &quot;Spare Fighter&quot;, meaning he can be paired with any sacrifice.!~ (Source: Wikipedia)",

                    "description": "Is twelve years old, and the protagonist of the story. His \"true name\" is Loveless. Two years ago, he had an abrupt change of personality and became the opposite of his former self. Before, he was a popular, average grade student; now, he doesn't get along with his classmates, but he gets perfect scores. Along with the personality change, he suffered a loss of all his memories. The cause of these drastic changes is still unknown, although he has regular therapy sessions to determine why.  Ritsuka, on his first day at his new school, meets Soubi Agatsuma for the first time. Soubi confuses him with his sudden intimacy and puzzling claims that he was Seimei's fighter. As Ritsuka discovers, Seimei's impromptu will dictates that Soubi shall \"become Ritsuka's\" upon his death. Ritsuka deeply admired and idolized Seimei, and to discover later there were many things kept secret came as a great shock. It further poisoned his difficulty in trusting others, particularly Soubi.  Despite his young age and inexperience due to his amnesia, Ritsuka is very intelligent and approaches things with startling maturity. The circumstances of his life encourage his lack of innocence; however, there have been notable incidents that bare his still-strong naivety, particularly in sexual love and dating. Despite this, he still has firm opinions and unrelenting ideas about those subjects. It is these opinions that clash dramatically with adults and authority figures around him, most notably Soubi. Ritsuka is a pacifist, and strongly opposes violence under any circumstance. Soubi has remained fairly silent on the issue; however, he seemingly doesn't object to pain and punishment under certain circumstances.  Love is an uncomfortable subject for Ritsuka. He is wary of compliments, and doesn't like hearing phrases such as \"I like you.\" Early on in the series, Soubi says \"I love you\" frequently, which Ritsuka doesn't believe is true. Because of Ritsuka's cynical reaction, Soubi stops saying it altogether after volume 2 of the manga. Still, Ritsuka's inner conflict over whether he believes what Soubi says becomes a source of great tension and bitterness in their relationship.  ~!More recent developments in the series revealed Soubi as the BELOVED imposter. Even after having knowledge of this, Ritsuka still insisted on remaining as Soubi's sacrifice. Ritsuka mentioned that he had always suspected this much about Soubi considering that Soubi constantly refused to disclose any information about himself and Seimei.!~ (Source: Wikipedia)",

He helps keep track of Ritsuka by spying on him and reports the information back to a mysterious boss. He and Soubi meet in volume 6 and from then on, Nisei stops spying on Ritsuka, but his presence is still near.    His role in volume 5 was a pivotal one: he was first introduced as &quot;Seimei,&quot; although he was only masquerading as Seimei to gain the trust of Misaki. It is unknown if it was carried out by Seimei&#039;s orders, but Nisei ended up drugging Misaki and trying in vain to convince her to murder Ritsuka, on the promise that Seimei would come back for good. Due to his smug demeanor and malicious behaviour towards Ritsuka, Nisei and Soubi have great animosity between each other. In volume 6, Soubi expresses his deep desire to murder Nisei at any cost.     There is a strong belief among fans that Nisei is a psychopath, judging by his actions and the way he says he can&#039;t experience feelings such as love or desire.      __Source:__ Wikipedia",

                    "description": "Ritsuka's older brother. He was seventeen when he was found murdered, although he died under mysterious circumstances and could only be identified by his dental records. We later learn that Seimei had faked his death, but who was the person that died in his place has not yet been revealed. He is also the sacrifice of the Beloved pair. Soubi was given to Seimei (mostly at Seimei's request) as a fighter when Seimei was only 14 years old. It is speculated by fans that there is some kind of rivalry between Seimei and Ritsu over Soubi and perhaps over other things, but there's no information in the series that confirms these speculations.  When Ritsuka lost his memory, Seimei stepped in and became an extremely important figure in his life. He protected Ritsuka from their abusive mother, Misaki, and was a great source of comfort and trust. As a result, Ritsuka was hit hardest of all by the news of his brother's death. He is very bitter and vengeful towards those who may have been involved in the killing of his brother.  His personality is subject of great debate, and many readers have very different interpretations of his actions. To make things more confusing, the characters in the story themselves clash with their different beliefs and experiences. Ritsuka, Soubi, and Misaki claim Seimei was a kind, gentle, loving person. In contrast, everyone else has the very opposite idea: they say he was cruel, merciless, and hateful. They claim Seimei acted strangely and would be close to no one, and go so far as refusing to eat in the presence of anyone else. Ritsuka denies all of this; however, in recent chapters published in spring 2006 he has some startling flashbacks that show a more disturbed, obsessive side of Seimei, and even sometimes borderline incestuous behavior towards Ritsuka.  In flashbacks in later manga chapters, it has become increasingly clear that Seimei suffers from mysophobia, a fear of contamination of dirt or germs, although it is largely reader speculation based off his obsessive behaviour about cleanliness and such innocent items such as homemade food being \"dirty.\"  Currently, he and Nisei, the true Beloved fighter, have traveled to Goura and has infiltrated the Academy of Seven Voices. His reasons for this infiltration has not yet been revealed. He betrayed Nisei by refusing to assist him in a two vs. one spell battle with Ritsuka and Soubi. This kind of action is very much consistent with the many negative beliefs that most of the characters in the series have about Seimei.",

On Ritsuka's first day in school, she immediately is overcome with awe and fascination. At the prodding of her mean-spirited classmates, she befriends him, although he is very reluctant. As Ritsuka overcomes his initial impressions of her and realizes she is rather smart, they become good friends.  Yuiko and Ritsuka's friendship greatly irritates their classmate, Yayoi. He had been recently rejected by Yuiko, although rather sorrowfully, claiming she only dated boys taller than her. Much to Yuiko's dismay, Ritsuka insists their friendship is platonic and it indeed remains that way. However, in two separate confessions to Shinonome Hitomi, Yuiko professes her love and devotion to Ritsuka. Their relationship is close, but Yuiko's seems to be a one-sided obsession. One incident of Ritsuka actually demonstrating care for Yuiko is in volume 2 of the manga and episode 4 of the anime, when she is bullied by her 'friends', whom Ritsuka fittingly said were using her. Because she had brought Ritsuka some homemade strawberry jam, they went so far as to smash the jar in front of her, and demanded she apologize for breaking school rules. Ritsuka came to her aid and stated that they were 'less than human'. This may have spurred on her love for him. Though, sadly for her, a notable scene in volume 4 depicts Ritsuka abandoning Yuiko abruptly to go to Soubi's aid, and Yuiko sadly recalls her efforts to become good friends with Ritsuka, but never achieving any results.  As the series progresses, a rather unusual yet harmonious friendship is struck between Yuiko and Soubi. Although it seems their personalities would clash, they have a unique understanding of each other.  In an early 2005 interview in Japanese magazine Pafu, Kouga Yun stated: \"She emerged when I wondered, 'What kind of girl would it take for Ritsuka to be happy?' While she was created to match Ritsuka, she changes from meeting him...with some injection of intelligence (laugh). She honestly wants to change to become worthy of Ritsuka because she likes him. So if Soubi wasn't around, they'd make a great couple (laugh).\"  (Source: Wikipedia)",

Despite his early presence as a character who exists solely to create a lighter atmosphere among a very dark story, he gradually gains depth and justifies his existence as the story progresses. He becomes a loud voice that champions pacifism and self-worth. This contrasts strongly against Soubi's submissive nature that willingly accepts violent treatment and strongly desires to be completely controlled, albeit from only very certain people. More significantly, Kio's views are shared by Ritsuka. Together, they provide a very black-and-white atmosphere that allows only one line of thinking.  (Source: Wikipedia)",

A good example of this is in volume 5, when Ritsuka rushes home after curfew, and Soubi remarks that Ritsuka will probably get a \"beating\". Natsuo and Youji are both amused by this, and say, \"A mother abusing her child! That's the best!\" while grinning happily.  Nagisa is unashamedly biased towards Youji, often ignoring Natsuo. According to Youji, this is because he bears a significant resemblance to Nagisa's younger sister.   (Source: Wikipedia)",

Although Nagisa is very young in appearance, it is later revealed that Nagisa is over 30 years old. Her background, and affiliation are unknown. She had a sister, but what has become of her has not yet been confirmed. She created Youji after the image of her younger sister, perhaps in remembrance or to ease the pain in her heart, but exact reasons are still unknown. Her over-the-top behavior and strange lifestyle leaves her alone and alienated. She befriends Nana, and shamefully confesses that she is her only friend.  Her relationship with Ritsu is an intriguing one. She puts up a front of hating him deeply, and wishing for nothing more than to see him fail. However, there are small moments that reveal possibly more intimate feelings, as she blushes deeply whenever he is near her or touches her, though she steadfastly denies caring for him. Starting in volume 3 and finishing in volume 4, she makes a bet with Ritsu that her older Zero pair, Yamato and Koya, can beat Ritsuka's Soubi. Ultimately, Yamato and Koya are defeated, and Nagisa's sibling rivalry-like attitude towards Ritsu continues.  (Source: Wikipedia)",

Both teams are experiments created by Nagisa at different times, and the female pair is presumably the first generation. Despite their unusual background, both Kouya and Yamato attend high school, although different ones.    Kouya, unlike Yamato, is very serious and does not take things lightly. She is reserved though Yamato is the only one who is able to get her to open up.     She meets Yamato when they are both young and were trained together to work as the Zero pair. While growing up, her feelings for Yamato grew stronger until both girls had fallen in love with one another.     She is deeply in love with Yamato despite trying to hide it from others. Her cold, aloof exterior is armour for her true feelings; she is truly afraid that she will lose Yamato. It gets to the point that she even ends up throwing up from fear at the idea of being separated from her lover and pair.     It is more than evident that Kouya has had sex with Yamato, as both girls clearly have a physical and romantic relationship alongside their professional relationship as Zero. In an interesting demonstration of the series&#039; fictional world&#039;s rules and expectations of society, Kouya wears fake cat ears despite not being a virgin. Yamato often teases her about it, particularly because Yamato doesn&#039;t try to hide her status. ",

At twenty-three years old, she is teased and ridiculed for retaining her ears (and therefore her virginity) to such an age. She is visibly embarrassed, but as the story progresses, she gains confidence and pride over making her own choices.  Hitomi is greatly troubled by Ritsuka's mother and the injuries he sustains from her, and greatly desires to involve herself in the situation to make a change, despite her fears and her colleagues' dissent.  Her very caring and naive nature clashes spectacularly when confronted with Soubi. He brusquely rejects her and says he doesn't care for older women, despite the fact she never made a romantic move towards him and no more than three years older than him. Despite his cold treatment, Hitomi seems to have had some feelings for Soubi, due to the fact in volume 2 of the manga (episode 8 of the anime), she burst into tears and brooded over him. His brash actions are mysterious, but understood a bit more when you consider his undiscerning hatred towards teachers as a result of his experiences with Ritsu Minami.  Although he has rejected her, it can be noted that Soubi enjoys tormenting her to some degree. In their first meeting, he takes pleasure in confronting her uneasily face-to-face. In volume 2 of the manga (episode 6 of the anime), he holds her closely when she faints. This is notable because there are only two characters he physically interacts with in the entire series: one being Hitomi and the other Ritsuka.  Reasons for this awkward behavior towards Hitomi may be stemmed from jealousy. It is interesting to note that Soubi refers to Hitomi as 'childish', despite her being three years older than he is. Yet he still respectfully calls her \"Shinonome-sensei.\" The only way he degrades her is by her sexuality, possibly because Hitomi has remained a virgin while he may have lost his ‘ears’ at a much earlier age, perhaps unwillingly. In volume 2 of the manga and episode 6 of the anime, Soubi also 'saves' Hitomi from the male Zeroes, Youji and Natsuo. They threatened to get rid of her ears, despite the Zeroes being very young themselves, and she protested immensely. Although she is grateful for Soubi's protection, it only embarrasses her more. In comparison with his extreme dislike of his own teacher figure, Ritsu, Soubi still manages to treat Hitomi as a subordinate, constantly belittling her. Ultimately, their relationship highlights traditional sexual tension, complementing the major same sex pairings and adding interest and variety to the story.  (Source: Wikipedia)",

Yayoi admits that he loves Yuiko, but when he confessed to her he was rejected. Yuiko claims her reason was that she only dates boys taller than her, but the truthfulness of that statement is called into question when it is painfully obvious she loves Ritsuka, who is just as short as Yayoi.  Despite his jealousy of Ritsuka's close friendship with Yuiko, he is encouraged by Ritsuka's adamant claims that their relationship is purely platonic. He makes a firm statement he will not give up on Yuiko, and spends more time with her than ever.  It is notable that in the manga, Yayoi has a rather small role. He is absent for large parts of the story, and has only a small amount of dialogue. In the anime, they utilized his character much more to enhance the would-be love triangle of Yayoi + Yuiko + Ritsuka, and to inject comic relief into a dark story.  (Source: Wikipedia)",

In Japanese, Yotsuba's dialogue is written without kanji, making it seem simpler and more child-like, and in a typeface that gives the impression of speaking with high intensity. Her energy is noted by other characters, especially members of the neighboring Ayase family. Her father says of her carefree nature, \"She can find happiness in anything. Nothing in this world can get her down.\" However, when deeply frightened or upset, she does cry, and she has an unexplained fear of anything resembling a bullseye.\n\nAt the start of the series, Yotsuba is shown as having very little knowledge of the world around her, even for a young child. Things such as swings, doorbells, cicadas, and air conditioners all fascinate and confuse her, although she is not perturbed by her ignorance. She occasionally mispronounces new words and creates neologisms, such as \"Yotsubox\" as a portmanteau of \"Yotsuba's Box\", and often repeats, in incongruous ways, phrases spoken by adult characters around her.\nYotsuba is frequently shown drawing, though she is not as good an artist as she thinks she is, and she is an excellent swimmer.\n\nThe series provides few details about her life before its start. She is an adopted child, with her birthplace unknown to the reader, although she claims she's from an island \"to the left.\" Koiwai, Yotsuba's adopted father, says he met her as an orphan in a foreign country and before he knew it he was raising her as his own; she is sometimes taken for a foreigner by strangers. When asked about her mother, she doesn't understand the question, and she gets confused by the concept of having two sets of grandparents. Before moving to her current home, Yotsuba lived in the country with Koiwai and his mother. She initially claims to Fuka Ayase she is six years old, but her father later corrects this, saying she is in fact five years old. Yotsuba has never attended school, and as of the first chapter does not know what a grade is. In chapter 35, she fails to understand repeated explanations of homework.",

He is depicted as something of a slacker; he habitually wears an undershirt and boxer shorts when working at home during the summer, and apologizes more than once for being irresponsible. He works from home as a translator, though what languages and materials he translates is unknown. Regardless of his skills as a parent, Koiwai tries to be a good father to Yotsuba.",

He helps the Koiwais move in and frequently visits their house, where he is more or less treated as a member of the family by Yotsuba.\n\n__Personality__: Jumbo has a dry sense of humor and is prone to deadpan quips, which sometimes confuse members of the Ayase family. At the same time, he is impulsive, and sometimes spontaneously organizes activities for the younger children, such as fishing and star-gazing.\nAs he does this, he enters a bizarre one-sided rivalry with Miura, including spending a single day in Hawai&#039;i after he learns that she will be going abroad. He develops a deep infatuation with Asagi when he first meets her, but is too nervous around women to directly act on it. Instead, he tries to use Yotsuba&#039;s friendship with Asagi as a way of getting close to her, though his plans usually backfire.",

                    "description": "Rally is the leader and founder of AMP. Rally does not wear the AMP uniform, but instead dresses in formal business suits.  As commander of the AMP, Rally is highly concerned with the welfare and well being of the officers under her command. She realizes that her officers undergo stresses totally unlike that of normal police officers, and thus, is more concerned with results than specific regulations. Rally is very business-like in all her dealings, both with her own officers and with other police officials. Rally even has a sense of humor, but it's kept hidden.  There is little hard data to be found on Rally. Her personal files contain a large number of blanks. The age given above is conjectural: in the tenth volume of the manga (set in early 2030), she refers to her first meeting with Ganossa Maximillian as occurring thirty years ago (1999 or 2000) and that she was eight at the time. However, she states in volume 3 (2027) that she was born thirty years ago.  Her private life is a total mystery, as well as such simple details as where she lives. If she has any romantic attachments is unknown. It is known that Rally has a sister by the name of Rosa, who has sided with the Lucifer Hawk.  Rally and Rosa are half-Lucifer Hawk. This gives them great magical powers, though they are rarely shown. When Rosa was first introduced, Rally experienced flashbacks to her childhood that included persecution of the 'devil's children.' As a result, the older sibling is often reluctant to use her powers.  Their parents are most likely dead; a woman named Lufa (spelling uncertain) with a strong resemblance to Rally showed up in one episode of the TV series, Mobius Klein, with a few indications that she was Rally's mother. She was part of the old Sorcerers' Guild with Gigelf Liqueur, Avalanche Wong, Genvara Cheng, and several others. Her main magical power was teleportation. (In manga 3 she tells her fellow AMP people that her mother was human but her father was from the Lucifer Hawk.)  Rally seems to have significant financial resources, as shown by the fact that she engineered a buyout of the privatized Japanese police department in early 2030 or late 2029. The initial founding of the AMP may also be considered evidence, though it is unknown if she had other backers at the time.",

She used to be intimately involved with Genvara Cheng, the previous wielder of Gesso. Genvara's connection to Lum Cheng is unknown.  A strict disciplinarian, Mana has little tolerance for tardiness or other offenses.  Mana was once possessed by the Demon Sword Medium which also takes control of Katsumi for a time.

Her primary power is precognition and clairvoyance. However, as it is explained in the anime (episode XRP - 77 by the character Annie) she also possesses the power of the other three subjects, which means that she also possesses the ability to teleport things (including herself and a group of people), create force shields capable of reflecting or neutralising various attacks and cause things to explode with the power of her mind, all of these powers make her capable (as confirmed by Toru in the very last episode of the anime) of \"changing the future with her own hands\".  She was found by Rally Cheyenne in the street crying and was later recruited for her enormous psychic powers, Yuki is the team's 'mascot', dispatch officer and Lebia's data processing assistant. Although Yuki sometimes acts a little airheaded (she's only a teenager), she can show a great deal of courage when needed  Yuki runs a small coffee shop called Labyrinth, but it is more a hobby than a business since she is a full-time police officer. However, the lease stipulates that as long as she runs it, she doesn't have to pay rent. (It is later revealed that this is because Toru Washio, her life-long love owns the building  she lives in).  She met her love interest, Toru Washio in 1997 as a result of an encounter with a Lucifer Hawk and a magical coffee mill. He was 17 at the time and she was 18. They met again after Yuki returned to her own time, 2027, Toru having waited over thirty years for her.  Towards the end of the anime it is revealed that Touru was also responsible for founding project YLPER - he had sold his soul to Nemesis so that he could see Yuki again, when he finally understood the plans that Ganossa had for Earth and Nemesis, he started the above project so that the humans \"had a chance to win over the Lucifer Hawks\" (episode 26).",

                    "description": "These creatures come in many forms, and many are shapeshifters. In the TV series, the AMP classifies them into three categories:            * Category III: low-level creatures that are little more than animals. These often resemble snakes or mantas or other animals.          * Category II: beings of slightly less than human intelligence and modest magical powers. There is great variation in their appearance. These usually appear capable of summoning various category III Lucifer Hawks that act as their \"minions\".          * Category I: typically somewhat humanoid with magical powers equal to those of even the most power human mages. At least as intelligent as humans, this category is very eloquent and prone to various mind games as shown in the anime.            * Category IV: Human-Lucifer Hawk hybrids. Not a real category in the AMP's classification, as it only appears in an illusion crafted by Ganossa Maximillian to trap Katsumi Liqueur. She and the Cheyenne sisters are the only known members of this class.        The more powerful Lucifer Hawks are capable of assuming human form and large collections of lower level ones can take on the form of large objects, such as the AMP's Simurgh command vehicle. Lucifer Hawks can meld with physical objects such as buildings or computers. The more powerful ones have great regenerative powers, but ordinary handguns can kill the lesser ones.        Lucifer Hawks are capable of breeding with humans, as evidenced by the Cheyenne sisters. According to Grospoliner, Katsumi (and possibly other mages) have distant blood ties to the Lucifer Hawk from liaisons many generations ago. ",

He uses the Fire Dragon sword, and later the Light Dragon Sword, as his weapon. He also boasts Ice and Fire magic and a strange ability to both create temporary copies of himself and to absorb others' powers, along with special ties to the Light Dragon. It is now known that he wasn't the true Dragon Knight of Fire. Rath harbors a great amount of self-hate, frequently projecting this hatred onto others. In volume 19, he also nearly commits suicide by Thatz Earth Dragon Sword. It takes a special person and a lot of effort to break through his many masks. He is also the only heir to the Dragon Lord. He is somehow related to the Demon Lord and believes that he shouldn't be living. Cesia and Rune are those that Rath acts naturally around. When he and Cesia travel together to look for a way to revive Crewger, Rath's demon dog, he begins to develop feelings for Cesia. He would do anything to save her from the many demons that are after her.      Rath used to be an evil spirit that had possessed the dead body of the Dragon dog, Illuser. Lykouleon used his blood to turn it into one of the Dragon Tribe. After going to Nadil's castle to rescue Cesia with Rune and Thatz, Rath is captured and Cesia releases all the souls that were held inside of Rath, most notably Gil and Bierrez, and Rath disappears. It is unknown whether or not Rath is dead at this point or not and the story seems to indicate that Cesia will bring him back again at some later point.      When Cesia finally revives Rath once more, he goes back to Nadil's castle where Nadil reveals that Rath is the Demon King. This finally explains Karl's inexplicable loyalty to Rath and Rath's ability to continually return to life in different bodies.   (Source: Wikipedia)",

He is able to create demons from captured faeries using his alchemy (An alchemist in this world is one who &quot;creates souls&quot;, not one who tries to create gold.). He can transform other species as well into demons using demon seeds, which infect the body and change it into an alternate demonic form. He uses two &quot;birds&quot;, which are sometimes referred to as his &quot;wings&quot;, to aid him in this process. Left Bird creates minds, while Right Bird creates bodies. Left Bird was killed by Rath, halting Kharl's construction of intelligent demons, but has a connection to the small demon named Zoma... Kharl also is the writer of the &quot;Demon Bible&quot;, a &quot;how-to&quot; guide on creating demons out of your own force. He also has several clones floating around, and a Demon Dog named Sinistora which he crafted to look suspiciously like the dead Snow Crewger and Ice Illuser. Very interested in anything unusual, Kharl is fascinated with strange plants, food demons, and humans. Strangely enough, Kharl has taken in a human boy named Garfakcy and prolonged his life, keeping him as a maid-cook-gardener-spy-assassin-experiment. He is also a slob and tends to forget things and make messes. His role is that of a mad scientist. Kharl also harbors a strong craving for Rath: he wants to steal him back from the Dragon Tribe, but is finding himself strangely unable to do so, and not because he lacks the power needed. It is revealed that Karl was a friend/adviser of the Demon King, Rath Illuser.  (Source: Wikipedia)",

A rebel demon, Bierrez keeps his loyalties to himself and dislikes being told what to do, often masterminding his own schemes rather than following orders. Due to an encounter with the Dragon Lord's blood as a young youkai, Bierrez used to be the only youkai able to enter the Dragon castle. While pretending to retrieve Cesia for Nadil's army, Bierrez actually attacked the Dragon Castle single-handedly in order to rescue her (though she didn't know it and refused to leave). He has a very close attachment to Cesia, having known her for several years, always watching out for her from behind the scenes and protecting her from other youkai who want her powers. While he appears to simply be trying to better his own place in life, Bierrez actually puts a lot of effort into doing what he thinks is best for Cesia; ultimately, he asked Rath to kill him in order to protect her. At the time of his &quot;death&quot; in the fourth volume, Bierrez possessed the Red Dragon Gem and was the Red Dragon Officer candidate. When Rath &quot;killed&quot; him, he absorbed the Red Dragon Gem. When revived by Cesia in volume 21, Bierrez agreed to become the Red Dragon Officer. He now refers to himself as a Dragon rather than as a yokai. Also Fedelta's younger brother.    (Source: Wikipedia)",

Despite his hopeless situation, he was rescued by a rebel Yokai named Raamganas, who took care of him and treated him fairly and whom Gil eventually fell in love with. But the mind control placed on him by Shyrendora enabled Nadil's army to toy with him, turning him into a merciless demonic beast and, in doing so, to kill Raamganas. Gil has little recollection of the things he did, and he lacks the power to stop it. He later killed his brother Barl's wife, as well as his niece Fiji. While Gil is one of Lord Nadil's prized demons, he is also the rightful Dragon Knight of Fire. Later on Gil takes back his title as a Dragon Knight.    (Source: Wikipedia)",

But when it suits her she seems to have the mind of an adult and displays omniscient tendencies, doing her best to warn the Dragon clan of impending disasters though apparently these preordained events must happen. She has some feelings for Alfeegi; she helped him and the Dragon King in a demon town, and as he was dying he kissed her.    (Source: Wikipedia)",
